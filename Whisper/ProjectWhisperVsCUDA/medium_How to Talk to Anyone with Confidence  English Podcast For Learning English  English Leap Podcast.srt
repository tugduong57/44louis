1
00:00:00,605 --> 00:00:07,293
Hey there, English learners!

2
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:16,202
Welcome back to the English Leap Podcast, your go-to place for real English conversation practice and to take your English to the next level.

3
00:00:16,963 --> 00:00:20,126
I'm Erin, and I'm so excited about today's episode.

4
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:27,556
Because today, we're talking about something everyone wants, but few people truly have.

5
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:29,277
Confidence.

6
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:38,685
You know that feeling when someone speaks so naturally, so easily, and you think, wow, how do they do that?

7
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:43,049
Well, that's exactly what we're going to explore.

8
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:49,018
How to talk to anyone with confidence, in English and in life.

9
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,906
Now, if you're a regular listener, you probably know that I usually host the show with Evan.

10
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:58,795
But today's episode is a little special.

11
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:00,960
Evan's taking a short break.

12
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:03,828
And we have a new voice joining us in the studio.

13
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:07,617
Everyone, please welcome Ben.

14
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:09,899
Hey everyone, so happy to be here.

15
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,623
And a little nervous too.

16
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:22,941
I've been listening to the English Leap podcast for a long time, and I've always admired how Erin and Evan make English learning feel like a real friendly conversation.

17
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:26,746
So, I'll do my best to keep up that vibe.

18
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:29,871
You'll be amazing, Ben.

19
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:34,719
You've got that calm, friendly energy that makes people want to listen.

20
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:36,028
Thanks, Erin.

21
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:39,713
And honestly, I couldn't think of a better topic for my first episode.

22
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:44,781
Talking to people, especially in English, can feel intimidating at first.

23
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:49,948
But once you learn how to stay calm and connect naturally, it changes everything.

24
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:51,191
Exactly.

25
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:52,593
And the good news?

26
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:56,179
You don't need to be perfect to sound confident.

27
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,748
You just need the right mindset and a few practical tools, which we'll share today.

28
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:06,933
And to make it even better, we've got a free PDF guide waiting for you.

29
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:13,580
You'll find all the key phrases, reflection prompts, and grammar practice from today's episode in the description below.

30
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:19,467
Plus, don't miss the ending because Crystal's vocabulary breakdown is back.

31
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:28,459
She'll explain some of the advanced and emotional words we'll be using today so you can really understand and use them in your own conversations.

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,401
Sounds like a great plan.

33
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,723
Ready to dive in?

34
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:32,933
Let's do it.

35
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:39,643
This is How to Talk to Anyone with Confidence, right here on the English Leap Podcast.

36
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:45,631
You know, Ben, before we jump into all the strategies, let's just be honest for a second.

37
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:50,978
Talking to people can be terrifying, right?

38
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:52,213
Totally.

39
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:55,677
Especially when it's in English, your second language.

40
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:58,421
You start thinking, what if I say something weird?

41
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:00,224
What if they don't understand me?

42
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,587
What if I forget words halfway through?

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,569
Yes.

44
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:09,597
It's like your brain suddenly hits pause right when your mouth is supposed to hit play.

45
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:10,799
Exactly.

46
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,201
And then you walk away thinking,

47
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,552
Why did I say that?

48
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:17,056
Or why didn't I say anything at all?

49
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,699
And it plays in your head for hours.

50
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,861
Been there.

51
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,424
Many, many times.

52
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:25,806
But here's the funny thing.

53
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:30,231
Everyone, even native speakers, feel like that sometimes.

54
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,213
Yeah, that's so true.

55
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:33,455
We all get nervous.

56
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:40,302
But the difference between confident people and nervous ones isn't that the confident ones never feel fear.

57
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,665
It's that they talk anyway.

58
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,449
Right.

59
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,116
Confidence doesn't mean being perfect.

60
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:49,885
It means being okay with not being perfect.

61
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:51,310
I love that.

62
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:55,080
Because half the time, the other person is just as nervous as you are.

63
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,246
They're thinking about how they sound.

64
00:03:57,597 --> 00:03:58,298
Exactly.

65
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:06,368
Everyone's busy worrying about their own English, their own smile, their own, uh, what do I say now moment.

66
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:13,118
So once you realize that, talking becomes a little lighter, a little easier.

67
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,983
But you know what really used to hold me back?

68
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:18,586
Comparing myself to other people.

69
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:25,055
Like, I'd be in a group and everyone sounded so fluent, and I'd just shrink into my chair.

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,723
Oh yes, I know that feeling so well.

71
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:33,428
I used to talk to really confident English speakers and think, do I even belong here?

72
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,990
Exactly.

73
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:37,653
It's like your mind starts ranking people.

74
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:44,639
They're better, they sound smarter, and suddenly you forget that you're a person too, not a performance.

75
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,081
Totally.

76
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,622
And that's what changed everything for me.

77
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:54,250
One day, I just told myself, no one's above me, and I'm not above anyone else.

78
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,093
We're all just people trying to connect.

79
00:04:57,894 --> 00:05:00,677
That's such a simple but powerful mindset shift.

80
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,446
Because when you drop that pressure to sound good, you actually start sounding more real.

81
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:07,427
Yes!

82
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:11,173
You stop trying to impress and start trying to connect.

83
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:13,815
And that's where confidence really begins.

84
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:18,802
Not in how perfect your grammar is, but in how genuine your heart is.

85
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:20,466
That's beautiful, Erin.

86
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:21,850
But here's the thing.

87
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,237
Once you stop comparing, there's another question that hits you.

88
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,064
Okay, but what do I actually say?

89
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:30,509
Right.

90
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:35,339
You finally feel brave enough to talk, and then your brain goes completely blank.

91
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:38,735
It's the classic, so, how's your week moment?

92
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,242
And your only reply is, uh, good?

93
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:43,807
Exactly.

94
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,555
I used to freeze every time someone asked me that.

95
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:50,002
And then I realized the problem wasn't my English.

96
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:53,851
It was that I never thought ahead about what I wanted to share.

97
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:54,778
That's so true.

98
00:05:55,358 --> 00:06:03,288
Now, before I go anywhere social, I just do a quick mental check, like, okay, what's one cool thing that happened this week?

99
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:04,269
Did I try something new?

100
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,192
Did I watch something interesting?

101
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:07,634
I do the same.

102
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:15,362
Sometimes I even write small notes in my phone, like, funny thing that happened at work, or that new cafe I tried.

103
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:18,286
It sounds silly, but it really helps.

104
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:19,824
Not silly at all.

105
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:21,327
That's smart.

106
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,031
It's like preparing your conversation toolbox.

107
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:28,478
Just a few small ideas ready in your mind so you're not caught off guard.

108
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:29,639
Exactly.

109
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:33,184
And if you're learning English, this is golden.

110
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:38,572
You can practice talking about those things out loud before you actually meet people.

111
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:42,317
It builds confidence and fluency at the same time.

112
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:46,257
Yeah, it's like doing a quick warm-up before a match.

113
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:50,100
You don't just run into the field cold, you stretch a little first.

114
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,464
Perfect comparison.

115
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:55,406
And here's the best part.

116
00:06:56,148 --> 00:07:00,291
Even if you didn't prepare anything, you can still start great conversations.

117
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:01,192
True.

118
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:05,317
Because sometimes, the best topics are right in front of you.

119
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,161
Exactly.

120
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:17,172
Like the last time I was waiting in a long coffee line, I just turned to the person next to me and said, wow, it feels like we're waiting for concert tickets, not coffee.

121
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:19,615
That's perfect.

122
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,720
It's funny, simple, and real, and boom, conversation started.

123
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,062
Yeah, and it didn't feel forced at all.

124
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:29,644
You just notice what's happening around you.

125
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:34,629
It could be the weather, the music playing, or even someone's bag.

126
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,112
anything small that connects you in the moment.

127
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:38,254
Totally.

128
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:41,059
And what's great is it works anywhere.

129
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,966
A cafe, a class, the gym, even an elevator.

130
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:47,048
You don't need a deep topic.

131
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:48,992
You just need to start.

132
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:53,740
And for our listeners, this is such a helpful skill in English.

133
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,725
You don't need big fancy sentences.

134
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:00,471
Just something like, it's really crowded today.

135
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:01,612
Or,

136
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,523
I love this song.

137
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:06,449
It's small talk, but it opens the door.

138
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:11,057
Yeah, it's like the first hello before a real chat begins.

139
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,262
Those tiny lines break the ice.

140
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,406
That's why they're called icebreakers.

141
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,569
Exactly.

142
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:21,879
And once you break the ice, that little bit of courage makes the next conversation easier.

143
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,538
Yeah, confidence really does grow one hello at a time.

144
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,543
And that brings us to something really important.

145
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:29,803
Practice.

146
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:35,511
Because honestly, the only way to stop feeling awkward is to go through the awkward.

147
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:38,475
So true.

148
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:40,357
You can't skip that stage.

149
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:41,980
You have to pass through it.

150
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:47,227
When I first started talking to strangers, I felt like my words had training wheels.

151
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:51,933
I was careful, slow, and terrified of falling.

152
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:53,720
That's such a great image.

153
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,565
And one day you realize you don't need those training wheels anymore.

154
00:08:58,385 --> 00:08:59,989
You just start speaking naturally.

155
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,974
The more you practice, the smoother it gets.

156
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:07,779
Saying hello, asking a question, making small talk.

157
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,023
It all becomes easier the more you do it.

158
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,505
Because small talk isn't small at all.

159
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,409
It's like the warmup before a marathon.

160
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:19,355
It might seem simple, but it helps you find your rhythm.

161
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:21,986
Right, and it's like exercise, too.

162
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:24,089
At first, your social muscles ache.

163
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:25,850
You overthink everything.

164
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:28,952
But with time, it starts to feel lighter and easier.

165
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:29,712
Totally.

166
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:30,975
And the best part?

167
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:33,557
You don't need hours of practice every day.

168
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,177
Just little moments.

169
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:36,860
Asking for directions.

170
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,620
Chatting with your barista.

171
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:40,903
Or saying thank you in full sentences.

172
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:41,583
Yes.

173
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:43,905
Every small conversation adds up.

174
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,168
Each one builds your confidence.

175
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:48,549
Not just in English, but in yourself.

176
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:51,418
And the beautiful thing is, mistakes don't stop you.

177
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:52,759
They teach you.

178
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:55,745
The faster you make them, the faster you learn.

179
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:57,768
There's a saying I love.

180
00:09:58,227 --> 00:10:00,711
If you're not making mistakes, you're not trying hard enough.

181
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:06,460
Every slip-up means you're stretching your comfort zone, and that's where growth happens.

182
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,721
Exactly.

183
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:10,326
Confidence isn't about never failing.

184
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:14,993
It's about realizing that failure doesn't hurt as much as silence does.

185
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:20,575
So true, and eventually you stop obsessing over grammar and start focusing on meaning.

186
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:25,058
That's when English begins to feel authentic, like it belongs to you.

187
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:27,020
Beautifully said.

188
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:31,826
You stop speaking to impress and start speaking to express.

189
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:34,249
That's real progress.

190
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:42,937
And the funny thing is, what really turned my conversations around wasn't speaking more, it was learning to listen with intent.

191
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:43,823
I love that.

192
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:46,687
Listen with intent.

193
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:52,294
Most people listen just to reply, but real connection starts when you listen to understand.

194
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:53,495
Exactly.

195
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:58,522
When you pay attention, you notice the subtext, the emotions hiding between the words.

196
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:03,828
It's like reading the room, not just the dictionary.

197
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,514
That's such a good way to put it.

198
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:13,884
And sometimes, mirroring what someone says, like, so you finally took that trip to Italy, helps build rapport.

199
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:15,547
It shows you care.

200
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:19,572
Yes, and that's what makes conversations flow.

201
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:23,116
You stop trying to fill the silence and start enjoying it.

202
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:27,522
It becomes less of a performance and more of a rhythm.

203
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,801
Exactly.

204
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,565
And when you do that, people open up.

205
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:33,827
They sense your presence.

206
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:37,793
At that point, fluency isn't just about vocabulary.

207
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,456
It's about emotional intelligence.

208
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:41,577
Absolutely.

209
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,422
Communication isn't about perfect sentences.

210
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:46,745
It's about shared meaning.

211
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:53,695
The moment you realize that, you stop worrying about sounding smart and start sounding sincere.

212
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:59,860
And that's when English stops being a subject you study and becomes a language you live.

213
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,144
That line gives me chills every time.

214
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:04,365
It's true.

215
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:11,094
When English becomes part of how you think, not just what you learn, everything changes.

216
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:13,196
Hmm.

217
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:13,356
Yeah.

218
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:17,061
And there's one more thing that people rarely talk about.

219
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:17,682
Oh?

220
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:18,923
What's that?

221
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:21,240
knowing when to end a conversation.

222
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:28,129
You can be great at starting one, but sometimes finishing it politely is the real challenge.

223
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:31,695
Yes, we've all been there.

224
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:38,804
That moment when the chat starts going in circles and you're just thinking, okay, how do I get out of this?

225
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,246
Exactly.

226
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:42,629
And here's where confidence really shows.

227
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,053
You don't have to vanish or make it awkward.

228
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:47,356
Just leave with kindness.

229
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,024
Right.

230
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:52,051
Something like, it's been great talking to you, I should get going.

231
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:56,076
Or, I'm gonna grab a coffee, but it was nice catching up.

232
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:59,020
Simple and friendly.

233
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:00,082
Totally.

234
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,707
You're not cutting the person off, you're closing the loop.

235
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:05,671
It leaves a positive final impression.

236
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,075
And that's what confident people do.

237
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,500
They start conversations with warmth and end them with grace.

238
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:13,393
Well said.

239
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:16,056
Because confidence isn't just about talking.

240
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:20,740
It's about knowing when to pause, smile, and walk away with respect.

241
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:21,883
Yes.

242
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:28,190
And if you can do that, start, connect, and end naturally, congratulations.

243
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,754
You already know how to talk to anyone with confidence.

244
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:33,395
Well said.

245
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:36,580
And for everyone listening, don't rush it.

246
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,822
Confidence isn't built overnight.

247
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:42,386
It grows with every real conversation you have.

248
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:43,317
Absolutely.

249
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:50,548
