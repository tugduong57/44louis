00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:52,213
Totally.

00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:53,215
Especially

start

404
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:56,338
thinking,

405
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,221
what

406
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,320
if

407
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:57,441
I

408
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,661
say

409
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:58,021
something

410
00:02:58,102 --> 00:02:58,421
weird?

411
00:02:59,022 --> 00:02:59,122
What

412
00:02:59,163 --> 00:02:59,203
if

413
00:02:59,242 --> 00:02:59,342
they

414
00:02:59,383 --> 00:02:59,524
don't

415
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:00,063
understand

416
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:00,224
me?

417
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:00,905
What

418
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:01,006
if

419
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:01,126
I

420
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:01,406
forget

421
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:01,907
words

422
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:02,306
halfway

423
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:02,587
through?

424
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,569
Yes.

425
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:05,371
It's

426
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:05,611
like

427
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:05,812

suddenly

430
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:06,993
hits

431
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:07,473
pause

432
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:07,835
right

433
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:08,034
when

434
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:08,194
your

435
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:08,436
mouth

436
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:08,575
is

437
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:08,915
supposed

438
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:09,015
to

439
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:09,197
hit

440
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:09,597
play.

441
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:10,799
Exactly.

442
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:11,659
And

443
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,759
then

444
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:11,919
you

445
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,161
walk

446
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,381
away

447
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,201
thinking,

448
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:13,572
Why

449
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:13,752
did

450
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:13,852
I

451
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:14,252
say

452
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:14,552
that?

453
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:14,973
Or

454
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:15,694
why

455
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:15,955
didn't

456
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,055
I

457
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:16,294
say

458
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:16,675
anything

459
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:16,776
at

460
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:17,056
all?

461
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:17,817
And

462
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:17,896
it

463
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:18,318
plays

464
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:18,457
in

465
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:18,638
your

466
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:18,897
head

467
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:19,118
for

468
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:19,699
hours.

469
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,600
Been

470
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:21,861
there.

471
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:22,842
Many,

472
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:23,122
many

473
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:23,424
times.

474
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:24,764
But

475
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:25,086
here's

476
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:25,225
the

477
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:25,506
funny

478
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:25,806
thing.

479
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:27,168
Everyone,

480
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:27,769
even

481
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:28,149
native

482
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:28,650
speakers,

483
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:29,250
feel

484
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:29,471
like

485
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:29,691
that

486
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,231
sometimes.

487
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:31,372
Yeah,

488
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:31,712
that's

489
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:31,913
so

490
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:32,213
true.

491
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:32,674
We

492
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:32,854
all

493
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:33,034
get

494
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:33,455
nervous.

495
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:34,597
But

496
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:34,736
the

497
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:35,157
difference

498
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:35,557
between

499
00:03:35,657 --> 00:03:36,117
confident

500
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:36,479
people

501
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:36,639
and

502
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,038
nervous

503
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,340
ones

504
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,040
isn't

505
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:38,181
that

506
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,300
the

507
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,842
confident

508
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:39,141
ones

509
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:39,521
never

510
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:39,862
feel

511
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:40,302
fear.

512
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:41,223
It's

513
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:41,384
that

514
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:41,585
they

515
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:41,884
talk

516
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:42,665
anyway.

517
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,449
Right.

518
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,532
Confidence

519
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:44,893
doesn't

520
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:45,174
mean

521
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:45,495
being

522
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:46,116
perfect.

523
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:46,877
It

524
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:47,239
means

525
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:47,639
being

526
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:47,941
okay

527
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:48,782
with

528
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:49,144
not

529
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:49,405
being

530
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:49,885
perfect.

531
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:50,808
I

532
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:51,090
love

533
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:51,310
that.

534
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:51,991
Because

535
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:52,252
half

536
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:52,393
the

537
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:52,653
time,

538
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:52,955
the

539
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:53,155
other

540
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:53,556
person

541
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:53,697
is

542
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:53,937
just

543
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:54,056
as

544
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:54,519
nervous

545
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:54,639
as

546
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:54,840
you

547
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,080
are.

548
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,741
They're

549
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:56,062
thinking

550
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:56,304
about

551
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:56,463
how

552
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:56,724
they

553
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:57,246
sound.

554
00:03:57,597 --> 00:03:58,298
Exactly.

555
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,520
Everyone's

556
00:03:59,599 --> 00:03:59,879
busy

557
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:00,360
worrying

558
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:00,621
about

559
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:00,861
their

560
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:01,162
own

561
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:01,682
English,

562
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,122
their

563
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:02,304
own

564
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:02,783
smile,

565
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:03,485
their

566
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:03,686
own,

567
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:04,627
uh,

568
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:05,087
what

569
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:05,247
do

570
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:05,348
I

571
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:05,587
say

572
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:05,848
now

573
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:06,368
moment.

574
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:08,111
So

575
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:08,391
once

576
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:08,573
you

577
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:09,052
realize

578
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:09,313
that,

579
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:10,616
talking

580
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:10,996
becomes

581
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:11,096
a

582
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:11,336
little

583
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:11,637
lighter,

584
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:12,518
a

585
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:12,758
little

586
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:13,118
easier.

587
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:13,960
But

588
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:14,039
you

589
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,200
know

590
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:14,381
what

591
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,021
really

592
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:15,282
used

593
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:15,361
to

594
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:15,562
hold

595
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:15,682
me

596
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:15,983
back?

597
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:17,345
Comparing

598
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:17,826
myself

599
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:17,966
to

600
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:18,206
other

601
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:18,586
people.

602
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:19,548
Like,

603
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:19,908
I'd

604
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:20,028
be

605
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:20,108
in

606
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:20,189
a

607
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:20,490
group

608
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:20,670
and

609
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,170
everyone

610
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:21,571
sounded

611
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,012
so

612
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:22,512
fluent,

613
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:23,153
and

614
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:23,293
I'd

615
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:23,593
just

616
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:24,115
shrink

617
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:24,355
into

618
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:24,514
my

619
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:25,055
chair.

620
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,641
Oh

621
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:26,062
yes,

622
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:26,442
I

623
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:26,601
know

624
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:26,781
that

625
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:27,142
feeling

626
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:27,423
so

627
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:27,723
well.

628
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:28,764
I

629
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:28,964
used

630
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:29,064
to

631
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:29,305
talk

632
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:29,444
to

633
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:29,865
really

634
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:30,406
confident

635
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:30,725

636
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:31,146
speakers

637
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:31,307
and

638
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:31,567
think,

639
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:32,408
do

640
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:32,548
I

641
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:32,788
even

642
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:33,168
belong

643
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:33,428
here?

644
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,990
Exactly.

645
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:35,651
It's

646
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:35,850
like

647
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:36,012
your

648
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:36,351
mind

649
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:36,711
starts

650
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:37,293
ranking

651
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:37,653
people.

652
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:38,314
They're

653
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:38,713
better,

654
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:39,035
they

655
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:39,394
sound

656
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:39,956
smarter,

657
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:40,755
and

658
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:41,276
suddenly

659
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:41,497
you

660
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:41,757
forget

661
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:41,918
that

662
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:42,197
you're

663
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:42,257
a

664
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:42,637
person

665
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:42,918
too,

666
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:43,178
not

667
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:43,238
a

668
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:44,639
performance.

669
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,081
Totally.

670
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:46,122
And

671
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:46,362
that's

672
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:46,541
what

673
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:46,903
changed

674
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:47,322
everything

675
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:47,483
for

676
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:47,622
me.

677
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:48,944
One

678
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:49,144
day,

679
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:49,185
I

680
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:49,564
just

681
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:49,786
told

682
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:50,225
myself,

683
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:51,107
no

684
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:51,326
one's

685
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:51,586
above

686
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:51,767
me,

687
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:52,408
and

688
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:52,687
I'm

689
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:52,848
not

690
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:53,108
above

691
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:53,449
anyone

692
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:54,250
else.

693
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,730
We're

694
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:54,889
all

695
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:55,170
just

696
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:55,692
people

697
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:56,533
trying

698
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:56,632
to

699
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:57,093
connect.

700
00:04:57,894 --> 00:04:58,074
That's

701
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:58,295
such

702
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:58,375
a

703
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:58,836
simple

704
00:04:58,896 --> 00:04:59,016
but

705
00:04:59,156 --> 00:04:59,716
powerful

706
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:00,317
mindset

707
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:00,677
shift.

708
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:01,459
Because

709
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:01,600
when

710
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:01,740
you

711
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:02,060
drop

712
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,261
that

713
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:02,721
pressure

714
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,002
to

715
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,622
sound

716
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:03,903
good,

717
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:04,543
you

718
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:04,963
actually

719
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:05,245
start

720
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:05,685
sounding

721
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:05,946
more

722
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:06,446
real.

723
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:07,427
Yes!

724
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:08,209
You

725
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:08,528
stop

726
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:08,889
trying

727
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,009
to

728
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,550
impress

729
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:09,891
and

730
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:10,211
start

731
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,572
trying

732
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:10,711
to

733
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:11,173
connect.

734
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:11,973
And

735
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:12,173
that's

736
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:12,353
where

737
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:12,975
confidence

738
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:13,336
really

739
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:13,815
begins.

740
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:14,617
Not

741
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:14,697
in

742
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:14,918
how

743
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:15,377
perfect

744
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:15,538
your

745
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:15,918
grammar

746
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:16,119
is,

747
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:16,920
but

748
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:17,000
in

749
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,240
how

750
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:17,862
genuine

751
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:18,081
your

752
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:18,362
heart

753
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,802
is.

754
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:19,725
That's

755
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,226
beautiful,

756
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:20,466
Erin.

757
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:21,269
But

758
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:21,468
here's

759
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:21,610
the

760
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:21,850
thing.

761
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:22,370
Once

762
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:22,531
you

763
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:22,791
stop

764
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:23,374
comparing,

765
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:23,793
there's

766
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:24,194
another

767
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:24,675
question

768
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:24,836
that

769
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:25,057
hits

770
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:25,237
you.

771
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,199
Okay,

772
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:26,701
but

773
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:26,982
what

774
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,141
do

775
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:27,262
I

776
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:27,682
actually

777
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:28,064
say?

778
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:30,509
Right.

779
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:31,331
You

780
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,692
finally

781
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:31,911
feel

782
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:32,153
brave

783
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:32,372
enough

784
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:32,473
to

785
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:32,814
talk,

786
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:33,295
and

787
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:33,456
then

788
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:33,615
your

789
00:05:33,656 --> 00:05:33,877
brain

790
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:34,117
goes

791
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:34,738
completely

792
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:35,339
blank.

793
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:35,608
It's

794
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:35,709
the

795
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:36,189
classic,

796
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:36,771
so,

797
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:37,271
how's

798
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:37,452
your

799
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:37,754
week

800
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:38,735
moment?

801
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:38,836
And

802
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:39,016
your

803
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:39,216
only

804
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:39,658
reply

805
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:39,879
is,

806
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:40,579
uh,

807
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,242
good?

808
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:43,807
Exactly.

809
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:44,649
I

810
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:44,810
used

811
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:44,911
to

812
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:45,190
freeze

813
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,432
every

814
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:45,673
time

815
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:45,992
someone

816
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:46,213
asked

817
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:46,314
me

818
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:46,555
that.

819
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:47,276
And

820
00:05:47,295 --> 00:05:47,416
then

821
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:47,497
I

822
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:48,098
realized

823
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:48,620
the

824
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,040
problem

825
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,380
wasn't

826
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:49,581
my

827
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,002
English.

828
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:50,725
It

829
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:50,865
was

830
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:51,064
that

831
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:51,165
I

832
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:51,466
never

833
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:51,766
thought

834
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:52,108
ahead

835
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:52,389
about

836
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:52,588
what

837
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:52,668
I

838
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:53,050
wanted

839
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:53,170
to

840
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,851
share.

841
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:54,156
That's

842
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:54,418
so

843
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:54,778
true.

844
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:55,538
Now,

845
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:56,100
before

846
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:56,259
I

847
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:56,439
go

848
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:56,841
anywhere

849
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,261
social,

850
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:57,762
I

851
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:57,922
just

852
00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:58,081
do

853
00:05:58,122 --> 00:05:58,141
a

854
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:58,423
quick

855
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:58,762
mental

856
00:05:58,843 --> 00:05:59,403
check,

857
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,624
like,

858
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:00,464
okay,

859
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:01,146
what's

860
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:01,386
one

861
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:01,726
cool

862
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:02,007
thing

863
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:02,166
that

864
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:02,487
happened

865
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:02,668
this

866
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:03,288
week?

867
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:03,428
Did

868
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:03,528
I

00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:03,749
try

870
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:04,069
something

871
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:04,269
new?

872
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,031
Did

873
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:05,110
I

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:05,391
watch

875
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,711
something

876
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:06,192
interesting?

877
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:07,132
I

878
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:07,233
do

879
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:07,353
the

880
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:07,634
same.

881
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:08,975
Sometimes

882
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:09,115
I

883
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:09,375
even

884
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:09,615
write

885
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:09,976
small

886
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:10,257
notes

887
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:10,377
in

888
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:10,516
my

889
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:10,877
phone,

890
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,098
like,

891
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:11,959
funny

892
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:12,199
thing

893
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,360
that

894
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:12,680
happened

895
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:12,779
at

896
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,081
work,

897
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:13,461
or

898
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,262
that

899
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:14,442
new

900
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:14,903
cafe

901
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:15,023
I

902
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:15,362
tried.

903
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:16,285
It

904
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:16,564
sounds

905
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:16,925
silly,

906
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:17,225
but

907
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:17,346
it

908
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:17,665
really

909
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:18,286
helps.

910
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:19,064
Not

911
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:19,425
silly

912
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:19,524
at

913
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:19,824
all.

914
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:20,687
That's

915
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:21,327
smart.

916
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:22,088
It's

917
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:22,269
like

918
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,668
preparing

919
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:22,810
your

920
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,410
conversation

921
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:24,031
toolbox.

922
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:24,791
Just

923
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:24,872
a

924
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:25,153
few

925
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:25,572
small

926
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:26,033
ideas

927
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:26,394
ready

928
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:26,475
in

929
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:26,634
your

930
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:26,975
mind

931
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:27,295
so

932
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:27,475
you're

933
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:27,636
not

934
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:27,916
caught

935
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:28,096
off

936
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:28,478
guard.

937
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:29,639
Exactly.

938
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:30,459
And

939
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,540
if

940
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:30,740
you're

941
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:31,040
learning

942
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,502
English,

943
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:32,202
this

944
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:32,463
is

945
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:33,184
golden.

946
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:34,346
You

947
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:34,526
can

948
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:35,067
practice

949
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:35,447
talking

950
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:35,708
about

951
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:35,927
those

952
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:36,247
things

953
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:36,449
out

954
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:36,788
loud

955
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:37,209
before

956
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,389
you

957
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:37,951
actually

958
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:38,211
meet

959
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:38,572
people.

960
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:39,492
It

961
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:39,773
builds

962
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:40,494
confidence

963
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:40,795
and

964
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:41,435
fluency

965
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:41,536
at

966
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:41,656
the

967
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:41,875
same

968
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:42,317
time.

969
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:43,413
Yeah,

970
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:43,553
it's

971
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:43,774
like

972
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:44,074
doing

973
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:44,154
a

974
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:44,454
quick

975
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:44,894
warm-up

976
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:45,175
before

977
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:45,235
a

978
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:46,257
match.

979
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:46,357
You

980
00:06:46,377 --> 00:06:46,497
don't

981
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:46,677
just

982
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:46,918
run

983
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,117
into

984
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:47,218
the

985
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:47,497
field

986
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:47,899
cold,

987
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:48,259
you

988
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:48,899
stretch

989
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,259
a

990
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,540
little

991
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:50,100
first.

992
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:52,824
Perfect

993
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:53,464
comparison.

994
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:54,286
And

995
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:54,545
here's

996
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:54,685
the

997
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:55,086
best

998
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:55,406
part.

999
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:56,307
Even

1000
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:56,387
if

1001
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:56,528
you

1002
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:56,788
didn't

1003
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:57,209
prepare

1004
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:57,790
anything,

1005
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:58,170
you

1006
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:58,350
can

1007
00:06:58,449 --> 00:06:58,750
still

1008
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,050
start

1009
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,411
great

1010
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:00,291
conversations.

1011
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:01,192
True.

1012
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:01,894
Because

1013
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:02,394
sometimes,

1014
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:03,115
the

1015
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:03,435
best

1016
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:03,915
topics

1017
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:04,057
are

1018
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:04,357
right

1019
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:04,536
in

1020
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:04,858
front

1021
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:04,958
of

1022
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:05,317
you.

1023
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,161
Exactly.

1024
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:06,920
Like

1025
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,201
the

1026
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:07,442
last

1027
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:07,661
time

1028
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:07,781
I

1029
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:07,922
was

1030
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:08,242
waiting

1031
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:08,343
in

1032
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:08,442
a

1033
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:09,084
long

1034
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:09,524
coffee

1035
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:09,824
line,

1036
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:10,545
I

1037
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:10,745
just

1038
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:11,045
turned

1039
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:11,125
to

1040
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:11,225
the

1041
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:11,545
person

1042
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:11,766
next

1043
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:11,867
to

1044
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:12,007
me

1045
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:12,127
and

1046
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:12,406
said,

1047
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:13,648
wow,

1048
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:14,129
it

1049
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:14,428
feels

1050
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:14,588
like

1051
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:14,769
we're

1052
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,050
waiting

1053
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:15,230
for

1054
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:15,730
concert

1055
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,110
tickets,

1056
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:16,732
not

1057
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,172
coffee.

1058
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:19,014
That's

1059
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:19,615
perfect.

1060
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:20,435
It's

1061
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:20,776
funny,

1062
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:21,355
simple,

1063
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:21,596
and

1064
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:22,016
real,

1065
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:22,216
and

1066
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:22,757
boom,

1067
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:24,199
conversation

1068
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:24,720
started.

1069
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,620
Yeah,

1070
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:25,740
and

1071
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:25,821
it

1072
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,060
didn't

1073
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,281
feel

1074
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:26,701
forced

1075
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:26,802
at

1076
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:27,062
all.

1077
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:27,942
You

1078
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:28,142
just

1079
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:28,504
notice

1080
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:28,744
what's

1081
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:29,144
happening

1082
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:29,425
around

1083
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:29,644
you.

1084
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:30,386
It

1085
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:30,545
could

1086
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:30,646
be

1087
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:30,745
the

1088
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:31,125
weather,

1089
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:31,726
the

1090
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:32,086
music

1091
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:32,548
playing,

1092
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:32,947
or

1093
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:33,209
even

1094
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:33,668
someone's

1095
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:34,629
bag.

1096
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,329
anything

1097
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:35,730
small

1098
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:35,930
that

1099
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:36,372
connects

1100
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:36,552
you

1101
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:36,632
in

1102
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:36,752
the

1103
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,112
moment.

1104
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:38,254
Totally.

1105
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:38,836
And

1106
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,036
what's

1107
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:39,396
great

1108
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:39,576
is

1109
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:39,877
it

1110
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:40,237
works

1111
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:41,059
anywhere.

1112
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,579
A

an

1120
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:44,966
elevator.

1121
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:45,826
You

1122
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:46,007
don't

1123
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:46,208

1127
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:47,569
You

1128
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:47,829

1132
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:49,632
And

00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:51,896

English.

1144
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:54,661
You

1145
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:54,882
don't

1146
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:55,201
need

1147
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:55,583
big

1148
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:56,124
fancy

1149
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:56,725
sentences.

1150
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:57,706
Just

1151
00:07:57,747 --> 00:07:58,067
something

1152
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:58,327
like,

1153
00:07:59,209 --> 00:07:59,348
it's

1154
00:07:59,408 --> 00:07:59,649
really

1155
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,130
crowded

1156
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,471

1157
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:01,612
Or,

1158
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,560
I

1159
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:02,901
love

1160
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:03,182
this

1161
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:03,523
song.

1162
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:04,504
It's

1163
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:04,865
small

1164
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:05,206
talk,

1165
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:05,607
but

1166
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:05,706
it

1167
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:06,048
opens

1168
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:06,187
the

1169
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:06,449
door.

1170
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:07,591
Yeah,

1171
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,031
it's

1172
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:08,252
like

1173
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:08,372
the

1174
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:08,713
first

1175
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:09,435
hello

1176
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:10,115
before

1177
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:10,196
a

1178
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:10,416
real

1179
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:10,677
chat

1180
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:11,057
begins.

1181
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:11,959
Those

1182
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:12,259
tiny

1183
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:12,600
lines

1184
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:12,882
break

1185
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:13,002
the

1186
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:13,262
ice.

1187
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:13,863
That's

1188
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:14,024
why

1189
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:14,245
they're

1190
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:14,564
called

1191
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:15,406
icebreakers.

1192
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,569
Exactly.

1193
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:17,451
And

1194
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:17,630
once

1195
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:17,771
you

1196
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:17,992
break

1197
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:18,132
the

1198
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:18,413
ice,

1199
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:18,793
that

1200
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:19,074
little

1201
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:19,235
bit

1202
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:19,314
of

1203
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:19,735
courage

1204
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:19,995
makes

1205
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:20,136
the

1206
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:20,377
next

1207
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:21,077
conversation

1208
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:21,879
easier.

1209
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:22,553
Yeah,

1210
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:23,134
confidence

1211
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:23,495
really

1212
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:23,776
does

1213
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:24,117
grow

1214
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:24,536
one

1215
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:24,978
hello

1216
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:25,117
at

1217
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:25,197
a

1218
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:25,538
time.

1219
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,399
And

1220
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:26,540
that

1221
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,819
brings

1222
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,000
us

1223
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,120
to

1224
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:27,461
something

1225
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:27,922
really

1226
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:28,543
important.

1227
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:29,803
Practice.

1228
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:30,745
Because

1229
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:31,245
honestly,

1230
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:31,786
the

1231
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:32,006
only

1232
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:32,167
way

1233
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:32,288
to

1234
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:32,567
stop

1235
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:32,868
feeling

1236
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:33,249
awkward

1237
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:33,909
is

1238
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,029
to

1239
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,250
go

1240
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:34,770
through

1241
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:35,010
the

1242
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,511
awkward.

1243
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:37,995
So

1244
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:38,475
true.

1245
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:39,256
You

1246
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:39,537
can't

1247
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:39,798
skip

1248
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:39,977
that

1249
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:40,357
stage.

1250
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:40,958
You

1251
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:41,220
have

1252
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:41,340
to

1253
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:41,600
pass

1254
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:41,860
through

1255
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:41,980
it.

1256
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:42,822
When

1257
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:42,922
I

1258
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:43,282
first

1259
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:43,643
started

1260
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:44,003
talking

1261
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:44,124
to

1262
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:44,644
strangers,

1263
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:45,245
I

1264
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:45,485
felt

1265
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:45,686
like

1266
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:45,846
my

1267
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:46,265
words

1268
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:46,427
had

1269
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:46,886
training

1270
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:47,227
wheels.

1271
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:48,028
I

1272
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:48,168
was

1273
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:48,769
careful,

1274
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:49,711
slow,

1275
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,511
and

1276
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:51,273
terrified

1277
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:51,373
of

1278
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:51,933
falling.

1279
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:52,778
That's

1280
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:52,999
such

1281
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:53,078
a

1282
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:53,339
great

1283
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:53,720
image.

1284
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,441
And

1285
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:54,701
one

1286
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:54,900

1287
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:55,182
you

1288
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:55,621
realize

1289
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:55,763
you

1290
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:55,962
don't

1291
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:56,222
need

1292
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:56,464
those

1293
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:56,844
training

1294
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,144

1295
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:57,565
anymore.

1296
00:08:58,385 --> 00:08:58,505
You

1297
00:08:58,547 --> 00:08:58,687
just

1298
00:08:58,726 --> 00:08:58,986
start

1299
00:08:59,047 --> 00:08:59,408
speaking

1300
00:08:59,467 --> 00:08:59,989
naturally.

1301
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:01,711
The

1302
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,890
more

1303
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,072
you

1304
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:02,652
practice,

1305
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:02,972
the

1306
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:03,533
smoother

1307
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:03,634
it

1308
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:03,974
gets.

1309
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:04,916
Saying

1310
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:05,375
hello,

1311
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:05,937
asking

1312
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:06,017
a

1313
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:06,618
question,

1314
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:07,058
making

1315
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:07,418
small

1316
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:07,779
talk.

1317
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:08,360
It

1318
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:08,500
all

1319
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:08,821
becomes

1320
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,241
easier

1321
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:09,361
the

1322
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:09,522
more

1323
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:09,701
you

1324
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:09,883
do

1325
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:10,023
it.

1326
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:10,764
Because

1327
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:11,104
small

1328
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:11,404
talk

1329
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:11,784
isn't

1330
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:12,145
small

1331
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:12,245
at

1332
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:12,505
all.

1333
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:13,307
It's

1334
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:13,528
like

1335
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:13,668
the

1336
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:14,129
warmup

1337
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:14,509
before

1338
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:14,548
a

1339
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:15,409
marathon.

1340
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:16,371
It

1341
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:16,591
might

1342
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:16,913
seem

1343
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:17,332
simple,

1344
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:18,014
but

1345
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:18,114
it

1346
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:18,375
helps

1347
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:18,554
you

1348
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:18,875
find

1349
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:19,056
your

1350
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:19,355
rhythm.

1351
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:20,384
Right,

1352
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:20,666
and

1353
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:20,905
it's

1354
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:21,145
like

1355
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:21,725
exercise,

1356
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:21,986
too.

1357
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:22,447
At

1358
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:22,726
first,

1359
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:22,927
your

1360
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:23,327

1361
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:23,727
muscles

1362
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:24,089
ache.

1363
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:24,749
You

1364
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:25,210
overthink

1365
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:25,850
everything.

1366
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:26,650
But

1367
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:26,770
with

1368
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:27,130
time,

1369
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:27,270
it

1370
00:09:27,311 --> 00:09:27,552
starts

1371
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:27,692
to

1372
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:27,912
feel

1373
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:28,312
lighter

1374
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:28,451
and

1375
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:28,952
easier.

1376
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:29,712
Totally.

1377
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:30,193
And

1378
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:30,293

1379
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:30,614

1380
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:30,975
part?

1381
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:31,695
You

1382
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:31,855
don't

1383
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,035
need

1384
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:32,436

1387
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:33,317
every

1388
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:33,557
day.

1389
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:34,337
Just

1390
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:34,778

1392
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:36,198
Asking

1393
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:36,359

Chatting

There's

Exactly.

Confidence

00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:11,106
It's

00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:11,948
realizing

1482
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:12,129
that

1483
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:12,649
failure

1484
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,009
doesn't

1485
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,269
hurt

1486
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:13,390
as

1487
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:13,650
much

1488
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:13,910
as

1489
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:14,451
silence

1490
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:14,993
does.

1491
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:15,509
So

1492
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:15,870
true,

1493
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:16,269
and

1494
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:16,811
eventually

1495
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,010
you

1496
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:17,311
stop

1497
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:17,772
obsessing

1498
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:17,991
over

1499
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:18,432
grammar

1500
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:18,893
and

1501
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:19,212
start

1502
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:19,774
focusing

1503
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:20,033
on

1504
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:20,575
meaning.

1505
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:21,195
That's

1506
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:21,375
when

1507
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:21,796
English

1508
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:22,135
begins

1509
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:22,275
to

1510
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:22,537
feel

1511
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:23,337
authentic,

1512
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:23,898
like

1513
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:23,998
it

1514
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:24,538
belongs

1515
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:24,719
to

1516
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:25,058
you.

1517
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,681
Beautifully

1518
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,020
said.

1519
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:27,942
You

1520
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:28,222
stop

1521
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:28,663
speaking

1522
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:28,883
to

1523
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,423
impress

1524
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:30,125
and

1525
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:30,404
start

1526
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:30,865
speaking

1527
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:31,225
to

1528
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:31,826
express.

1529
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:33,028
That's

1530
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:33,567
real

1531
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:34,249
progress.

1532
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,289
And

1533
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:35,389
the

1534
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:35,669
funny

1535
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:35,870
thing

1536
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,091
is,

1537
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:36,892
what

1538
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:37,231
really

1539
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:37,532
turned

1540
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:37,712
my

1541
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:38,432
conversations

1542
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:38,754
around

1543
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:39,094
wasn't

1544
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:39,514
speaking

1545
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:39,894
more,

1546
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:40,434
it

1547
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:40,596
was

1548
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:40,956
learning

1549
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:41,135
to

1550
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:41,677
listen

1551
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:42,297
with

1552
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:42,937
intent.

1553
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:43,322
I

1554
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:43,563
love

1555
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:43,823
that.

1556
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:44,924
Listen

1557
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:45,186
with

1558
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,687
intent.

1559
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:46,908
Most

1560
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:47,268
people

1561
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:47,668
listen

1562
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:48,009
just

1563
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:48,129
to

1564
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:48,610
reply,

1565
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,070
but

1566
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:49,431
real

1567
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,032
connection

1568
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:50,491
starts

1569
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:50,712
when

1570
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:50,893
you

1571
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:51,332
listen

1572
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:51,614
to

1573
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,294
understand.

1574
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:53,495
Exactly.

1575
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:54,017
When

1576
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:54,157
you

1577
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:54,336
pay

1578
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:54,857
attention,

1579
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:55,018
you

1580
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:55,458
notice

1581
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:55,578
the

1582
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,219
subtext,

1583
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:56,679
the

1584
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,201
emotions

1585
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:57,640
hiding

1586
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:57,981
between

1587
00:10:58,022 --> 00:10:58,101
the

1588
00:10:58,162 --> 00:10:58,522
words.

1589
00:10:59,322 --> 00:10:59,423
It's

1590
00:10:59,504 --> 00:10:59,703
like

1591
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:00,544
reading

1592
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:00,705
the

1593
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:01,025
room,

1594
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:01,725
not

1595
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:01,966
just

1596
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:02,067
the

1597
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:03,828
dictionary.

1598
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:04,413
That's

1599
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:04,614
such

1600
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:04,673
a

1601
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:04,874
good

1602
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:05,053
way

1603
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:05,153
to

1604
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:05,394
put

1605
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:05,514
it.

1606
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:06,495
And

1607
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:07,096
sometimes,

1608
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:07,957
mirroring

1609
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:08,197
what

1610
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:08,558
someone

1611
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:08,899
says,

1612
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:09,318
like,

1613
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,221
so

1614
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,400
you

1615
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:10,801
finally

1616
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,042
took

1617
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:11,221
that

1618
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:11,501
trip

1619
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:11,682
to

1620
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:12,003
Italy,

1621
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:12,984
helps

1622
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:13,364
build

1623
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:13,884
rapport.

1624
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:14,765
It

1625
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:15,047
shows

1626
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:15,187
you

1627
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:15,547
care.

1628
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:17,149
Yes,

1629
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:17,649
and

1630
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:17,909
that's

1631
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,070
what

1632
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,291
makes

1633
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,030
conversations

1634
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:19,572
flow.

1635
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:20,332
You

1636
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:20,552
stop

1637
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:20,774
trying

1638
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:20,874
to

1639
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:21,214
fill

1640
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:21,313
the

1641
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:21,855
silence

1642
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:22,054
and

1643
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:22,416
start

1644
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:22,975
enjoying

1645
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:23,116
it.

1646
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:24,177
It

1647
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:24,538
becomes

1648
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:24,918
less

1649
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:25,019
of

1650
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:25,119
a

1651
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:25,740
performance

1652
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,301
and

1653
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:26,640
more

1654
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:26,821
of

1655
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:26,921
a

1656
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,522
rhythm.

1657
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,801
Exactly.

1658
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:29,621
And

1659
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:29,782
when

1660
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:29,961
you

1661
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:30,123
do

1662
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:30,383
that,

1663
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:30,903
people

1664
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:31,344
open

1665
00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:31,565
up.

1666
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:32,525
They

1667
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:32,927
sense

1668
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:33,187
your

1669
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:33,827
presence.

1670
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:35,028
At

1671
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:35,230
that

1672
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:35,590
point,

1673
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,171
fluency

1674
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:36,510
isn't

1675
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:36,772
just

1676
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:36,991
about

1677
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:37,793
vocabulary.

1678
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:38,673
It's

1679
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:38,934
about

1680
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:39,716
emotional

1681
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:40,456
intelligence.

1682
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:41,577
Absolutely.

1683
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:42,759
Communication

1684
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,039
isn't

1685
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,280
about

1686
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,760
perfect

1687
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:44,422
sentences.

1688
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:45,102
It's

1689
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:45,364
about

1690
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:46,004
shared

1691
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:46,745
meaning.

1692
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:47,547
The

1693
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:47,846
moment

1694
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:48,006
you

1695
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:48,467
realize

1696
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:48,768
that,

1697
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:49,208
you

1698
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:49,469
stop

1699
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:49,990
worrying

1700
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:50,230
about

1701
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:50,671
sounding

1702
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:51,211
smart

1703
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:51,831
and

1704
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:52,153
start

1705
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:52,594
sounding

1706
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:53,695
sincere.

1707
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:54,094
And

1708
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:54,414
that's

1709
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:54,615
when

1710
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:55,034
English

1711
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:55,416
stops

1712
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:55,716
being

1713
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:55,796
a

1714
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:56,256
subject

1715
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:56,496
you

1716
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:56,856
study

1717
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:57,677
and

1718
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:58,158
becomes

1719
00:11:58,278 --> 00:11:58,298
a

1720
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:58,840
language

1721
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,360
you

1722
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,860
live.

1723
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,902
That

1724
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:01,243
line

1725
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:01,462
gives

1726
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:01,623
me

1727
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:02,144
chills

1728
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:02,783
every

1729
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:03,144
time.

1730
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:04,046
It's

1731
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:04,365
true.

1732
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:04,986
When

1733
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:05,407
English

1734
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:05,807
becomes

1735
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:06,148
part

1736
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:06,268
of

1737
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:06,469
how

1738
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:06,668
you

1739
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:07,068
think,

1740
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,750
not

1741
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,049
just

1742
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:08,370
what

1743
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:08,591
you

1744
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:09,011
learn,

1745
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:10,232
everything

1746
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:11,094
changes.

1747
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:13,196
Hmm.

1748
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:13,356
Yeah.

1749
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:14,197
And

1750
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:14,398
there's

1751
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:14,638
one

1752
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:14,878
more

1753
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:15,259
thing

1754
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:15,438
that

1755
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:15,798
people

1756
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,440
rarely

1757
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:16,760
talk

1758
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:17,061
about.

1759
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:17,682
Oh?

1760
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:18,523
What's

1761
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:18,923
that?

1762
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:19,739
knowing

1763
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:19,979
when

1764
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:20,099
to

1765
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:20,379
end

1766
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,480
a

1767
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,240
conversation.

1768
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:22,682
You

1769
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:22,822
can

1770
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:22,923
be

1771
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:23,163
great

1772
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:23,243
at

1773
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:23,624
starting

1774
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:23,844
one,

1775
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:24,345
but

1776
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:24,946
sometimes

1777
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:25,767
finishing

1778
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:25,866
it

1779
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:26,427
politely

1780
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:27,048
is

1781
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:27,188
the

1782
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:27,568
real

1783
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:28,129
challenge.

1784
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:30,253
Yes,

1785
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:31,114
we've

1786
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:31,254
all

1787
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:31,455
been

1788
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:31,695
there.

1789
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:32,275
That

1790
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:32,615
moment

1791
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:32,797
when

1792
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:32,897
the

1793
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:33,216
chat

1794
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:33,518
starts

1795
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:33,798
going

1796
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:33,937
in

1797
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:34,399
circles

1798
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:34,739
and

1799
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:34,940
you're

1800
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,100
just

1801
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:35,480
thinking,

1802
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,062
okay,

1803
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:37,803
how

1804
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:37,943
do

1805
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:38,063
I

1806
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:38,264
get

1807
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:38,445
out

1808
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:38,544
of

1809
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:38,804
this?

1810
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,246
Exactly.

1811
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:40,827
And

1812
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:41,067
here's

1813
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:41,227
where

1814
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:41,729
confidence

1815
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:42,190
really

1816
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:42,629
shows.

1817
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,230
You

1818
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,412
don't

1819
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:43,552
have

1820
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:43,652
to

1821
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:44,153
vanish

1822
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:44,332
or

1823
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:44,533
make

1824
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:44,633
it

1825
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:45,053
awkward.

1826
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:45,754
Just

1827
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:46,134
leave

1828
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:46,515
with

1829
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:47,356
kindness.

1830
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,024
Right.

1831
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:48,927
Something

1832
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:49,147
like,

1833
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:49,967
it's

1834
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:50,149
been

1835
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:50,389
great

1836
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:50,749
talking

1837
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:50,870
to

1838
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:51,070
you,

1839
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:51,409
I

1840
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:51,610
should

1841
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:51,730
get

1842
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,051
going.

1843
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:53,033
Or,

1844
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:53,974
I'm

1845
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:54,153
gonna

1846
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:54,414
grab

1847
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:54,475
a

1848
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:54,855
coffee,

1849
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:55,115
but

1850
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:55,196
it

1851
00:12:55,235 --> 00:12:55,336
was

1852
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:55,576
nice

1853
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:55,917
catching

1854
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:56,076
up.

1855
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:57,678
Simple

1856
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,620
and

1857
00:12:58,681 --> 00:12:59,020
friendly.

1858
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:00,082
Totally.

1859
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:00,683
You're

1860
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:00,823
not

1861
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:01,083
cutting

1862
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:01,184
the

1863
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:01,504
person

1864
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:01,764
off,

1865
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:02,225
you're

1866
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:02,807
closing

1867
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:02,947
the

1868
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:03,707
loop.

1869
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:03,807
It

1870
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:04,048
leaves

1871
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:04,129
a

1872
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:04,669
positive

1873
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:05,129
final

1874
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,671
impression.

1875
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:06,511
And

1876
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:06,773
that's

1877
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:06,932
what

1878
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:07,514
confident

1879
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:07,854
people

1880
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:08,075
do.

1881
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:08,875
They

1882
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:09,155
start

1883
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:09,976
conversations

1884
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:10,158
with

1885
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:10,538
warmth

1886
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:11,158
and

1887
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:11,460
end

1888
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:11,659
them

1889
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:11,879
with

1890
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,500
grace.

1891
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:13,072
Well

1892
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:13,393
said.

1893
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:14,153
Because

1894
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:14,734
confidence

1895
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:15,034
isn't

1896
