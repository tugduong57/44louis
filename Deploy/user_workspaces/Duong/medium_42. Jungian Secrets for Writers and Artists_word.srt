Jung

71
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:38,195

72
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:38,615
something

73
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:39,055
different.

74
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:39,936

He

83
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:45,243
painted

84
00:00:45,283 --> 00:00:45,542

but

101
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:55,701

107
00:00:59,604 --> 00:00:59,704
one

108
00:00:59,744 --> 00:00:59,865

127
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:08,435
deeply.

128
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:09,396
What

129
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:09,796
Jung

130
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:10,397
discovered

00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:12,558
just

143
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:16,003
upon

144
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:16,143
the

145
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:16,763

explains

157
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:22,676
why

158
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:23,156

165
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:28,022
Why

And

We're

220
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:52,740
the

human

222
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:53,861
experience.

223
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:55,003
Let's

224
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:55,343
begin

225
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:55,524
with

226
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:55,944
Jung's

227
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:56,204
most

228
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:56,745
radical

229
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:57,245
idea,

230
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:57,667
the

231
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:58,287
collective

232
00:01:58,507 --> 00:01:59,248
unconscious.

233
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:00,650
Unlike

234
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,171
Freud's

235
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:01,772
personal

236
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:02,653
unconscious,

237
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:03,774
which

238
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:04,215
stores

239
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:04,495

242
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:06,016
and

243
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:07,018
traumas,

244
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:07,951
Jung

245
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:08,473
proposed

246
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:08,673
that

247
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:09,373
beneath

248
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:09,574
our

249
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:10,134

250
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:10,675
psyche

251
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:11,235
lies

252
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:11,276
a

00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:12,897
a

inheritance

259
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,882
common

260
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:16,042
to

261
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:16,462
all

262
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:17,122
humanity.

263
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:18,305
Think

264
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:18,425
of

265
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:18,585
it

266
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:18,985
as

267
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:19,026
a

268
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:19,586

00:02:19,786 --> 00:02:20,326
underground

270
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:20,707
river

271
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:21,147
that

272
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:21,588
flows

273
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:21,989
beneath

274
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:22,128
the

275
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,650
surface

276
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:22,870
of

277
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,751
individual

278
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,491
consciousness,

279
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:25,873
connecting

280
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:26,334
every

281
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:26,715

283
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:27,716

time

285
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:28,576

286
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:29,138
culture.

287
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:29,959
But

288
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:30,299
here's

289
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:30,519
where

290
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:30,618
it

291
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:30,819
gets

292
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,621
fascinating

293
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:31,781
for

294
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,461
creators.

295
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:33,522
This

296
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:34,082
collective

297
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:34,843
unconscious

298
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:35,185
isn't

299
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:36,246
empty.

300
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:36,546
It's

301
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:37,288
populated

302
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:37,508
by

303
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:37,729
what

304
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:38,209
Jung

305
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:38,610
called

306
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,632
archetypes,

307
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:41,033
universal

308
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:41,594
patterns

309
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:41,735

310
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:42,195
human

311
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:42,937

312
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:43,318
that

313
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:43,457
have

314
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:43,617
been

315
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:44,218
sculpted

316
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:44,539
into

317
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,639
the

318
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,080

00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:46,864
millions

322
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:46,963
of

323
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:47,444
years

324
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:47,564
of

325
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:48,246
evolution.

326
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:49,147
These

327
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:49,407
aren't

328
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:49,868
learned,

329
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:50,330
they're

330
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,230
inherited.

331
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:51,987
They're

332
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:52,288
why

333
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:52,408
a

334
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:52,909
child

335
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:53,330
who's

336
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:53,591
never

337
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,850
seen

338
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:53,931
a

340
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:54,872
still

341
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:55,593
recoils

342
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:55,814
from

343
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:56,155
one.

344
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:56,996
Why

345
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:57,616
stories

346
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:57,737

00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,338
heroes

348
00:02:58,438 --> 00:02:58,838
slaying

349
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,419
dragons

350
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:00,061

351
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,043
independently

352
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:01,463

353
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:02,024

354
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:02,645
separated

355
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:02,825

millennia.

359
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:05,128
Why

360
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,550
certain

361
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:06,050
symbols

362
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:06,391

00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:06,532
the

367
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:08,474
whether

368
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:08,694
you're

377
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:13,462
This

378
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:13,582
is

379
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:14,805
transformative.

380
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:15,544
You're

381
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:15,686
not

385
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:17,908
You

386
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:18,128

When

you

00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:25,286
the

647
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,206
Jung's

649
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:26,706

650
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:26,826
the

654
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,651
unacknowledged

655
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,310

656
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:31,411
of

657
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:32,091
ourselves.

658
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:33,052
In

659
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:33,894

00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:34,754
the

662
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:35,634
often

663
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:36,255
appears

664
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:36,696
as

665
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:36,875
the

antagonist,

667
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:38,798
but

668
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:38,937
the

00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,000
something

674
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,641
crucial.

675
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:43,000
The

isn't

678
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:44,302
evil,

679
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:44,723
it's

680
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:45,903
disowned.

681
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:46,598

688
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:48,360
just

689
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,939
Batman's

690
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,360

691
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:49,781
he

692
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,422

693
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:51,081
chaos.

694
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:52,043
The

696
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:53,244

698
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:54,324

Batman

700
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:55,545

the

726
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:08,677
Manifested

727
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:08,958
as

731
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:10,980
Here's

732
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,079
a

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,500

736
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,802
revolutionize

00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:13,002
your

Your

00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,055

751
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,339
They

752
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:21,579

753
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:22,201
represent

This

766
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:28,911

These

her,

861
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:19,233
which

862
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:19,374
is

863
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:19,634

so

868
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:21,778
charged

869
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:21,958
and

870
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,339
transformative.

871
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:23,855
The

872
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:24,196
wise

873
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:24,456
old

00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:24,817
man

875
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:24,976
or

876
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:25,377
woman,

877
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:25,517
the

878
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:26,077
mentor

879
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:26,519
figure,

880
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:27,240
appears

881
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,360
in

882
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,000
everything

883
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,221
from

884
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,862
Gandalf

885
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:28,982
to

886
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:29,302
Mr.

887
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:30,824
Miyagi

888
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:31,526
to

889
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:32,307
Dumbledore.

890
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:33,427
This

891
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:34,129
archetype

892
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:34,670
represents

893
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:35,170
wisdom,

894
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:36,473
guidance,

895
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:37,514
and

896
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:37,634
the

897
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:38,175
connection

898
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:38,314
to

899
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:38,776
something

900
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:39,456
larger

901
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:39,916
than

902
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:40,036
the

903
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:40,838
individual

904
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:41,418
ego.

905
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,259
But

906
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,761
notice

907
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:43,262
that

908
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:43,382
the

909
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:43,682
most

910
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:44,362
effective

911
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:44,903
mentors

912
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:45,204
don't

913
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:45,584
solve

914
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:46,086
problems

915
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:46,266
for

916
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:46,365
the

917
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:46,826
hero.

918
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:47,346
They

919
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:47,687
ask

920
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:48,348
questions.

921
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:49,509
They

922
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:49,911
present

923
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:50,711
riddles.

924
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:51,603
They

925
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:52,043
create

926
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:52,725
conditions

927
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:52,904
for

928
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:53,807
transformation.

929
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:54,827
They

930
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:55,548
recognize

931
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:55,730
that

932
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:56,209
wisdom

933
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:56,550
can't

934
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:56,730
be

935
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,132
given.

936
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:57,531
It

937
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:57,773
must

938
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:57,973
be

939
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:58,533
earned

940
00:07:58,834 --> 00:07:59,053
through

941
00:07:59,095 --> 00:07:59,815
experience.

942
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:00,937
Now,

943
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:02,119
here's

944
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:02,358
where

945
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:02,939
Jung's

946
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:03,281
work

947
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:03,982
becomes

948
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:04,862
practically

949
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:05,584
applicable

950
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:05,964
to

951
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:06,185
your

952
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:06,706
creative

953
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:07,326
process.

954
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:08,548
Jung

955
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,028
developed

956
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:09,110
a

957
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,689
technique

958
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:10,071
called

959
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:10,891
Active

960
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:11,934
Imagination,

961
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:12,894
which

962
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:13,035
is

963
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:13,896
fundamentally

964
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:14,297
different

965
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:14,697
from

966
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:14,958
both

967
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:15,759
meditation

968
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:16,259
and

969
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,442
daydreaming.

970
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:17,742
It's

971
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:17,822
a

972
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:18,242
method

973
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:18,423
of

974
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:19,064
engaging

975
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:19,223
with

976
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:19,363
the

977
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:20,144
unconscious

978
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:20,586
mind

979
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:20,966
as

980
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:21,146
if

981
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:21,286
it

982
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:21,507
were

983
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:21,908
another

984
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:22,387
person,

985
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:22,548
a

986
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,249
dialogue

987
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:23,569
rather

988
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:23,730
than

989
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:23,810
a

990
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,110
monologue.

991
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:25,312
Here's

992
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:25,471
how

993
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:25,612
it

994
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,012
works.

995
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:26,512
You

996
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:26,814
begin

997
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:26,994
with

998
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:27,074
an

999
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:27,533
image,

1000
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:28,475
a

1001
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:29,276
character,

1002
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:30,218
or

1003
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:30,317
a

1004
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:30,819
feeling

1005
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:31,038
that

1006
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:31,298
has

1007
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:32,139
emotional

1008
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,681
charge

1009
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:32,880
for

1010
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:33,120
you.

1011
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:34,263
Instead

1012
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:34,342
of

1013
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:35,203
analyzing

1014
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:35,344
it

1015
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:35,524
or

1016
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:35,845
trying

1017
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:35,924
to

1018
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:36,465
control

1019
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:36,625
it,

1020
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:37,506
you

1021
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:38,006
engage

1022
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:38,227
with

1023
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:38,368
it.

1024
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:39,229
You

1025
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:39,489
ask

1026
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:39,568
it

1027
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:40,210
questions.

1028
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,171
You

1029
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,371
let

1030
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:41,471
it

1031
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:42,212
respond.

1032
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:43,374
You

1033
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:43,614
might

1034
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:43,875
write

1035
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:44,014
the

1036
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:44,816
dialogue,

1037
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:45,937
paint

1038
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:46,618
it,

1039
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:47,287
Move

1040
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:47,488
with

1041
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:47,607
it

1042
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,211
physically.

1043
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:49,034
The

1044
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:49,416
key

1045
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:49,616
is

1046
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:50,078
that

1047
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,321
you're

1048
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,480
not

1049
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:50,962
directing

1050
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:51,104
the

1051
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:51,706
content.

1052
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:53,092
You're

1053
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:53,475
allowing

1054
00:08:53,514 --> 00:08:53,615
the

1055
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:54,438
unconscious

1056
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:54,580
to

1057
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:54,981
reveal

1058
00:08:55,062 --> 00:08:55,764
itself.

1059
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:56,634
Many

1060
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:56,735
of

1061
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:56,855
the

1062
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,316
greatest

1063
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:57,756
writers

1064
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:57,937
have

1065
00:08:58,136 --> 00:08:58,297
used

1066
00:08:58,397 --> 00:08:58,918
versions

1067
00:08:58,977 --> 00:08:59,018
of

1068
00:08:59,077 --> 00:08:59,217
this

1069
00:08:59,298 --> 00:08:59,818
technique

1070
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:00,438
without

1071
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,159
necessarily

1072
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,561
knowing

1073
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:02,020
Jung's

1074
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:02,902
terminology.

Stephen

King

1077
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:04,543
has

1078
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:05,144
described

1079
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:05,345
how

1080
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:05,804
his

1081
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:06,346
characters

1082
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:06,605
take

1083
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:06,926
over

1084
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:07,067
and

1085
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:07,267
do

1086
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:07,567
things

1087
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:07,687
he

1088
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:07,967
didn't

1089
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:08,347
plan.

1090
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:09,548
Ursula

1091
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:09,909
K.

1092
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:10,870
Le

1093
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:11,211
Guin

1094
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,551
spoke

1095
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:11,652
of

1096
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,292
discovering

1097
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:12,471
her

1098
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:13,072
stories

1099
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:13,673
rather

1100
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:13,833
than

1101
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:14,455
inventing

1102
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:14,715
them.

1103
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:15,655
This

1104
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:15,936
isn't

1105
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:16,476
mystical

1106
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:17,278
nonsense.

1107
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:17,817
It's

1108
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:17,977
the

1109
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:18,818
unconscious

1110
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:19,240
mind

1111
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,120
presenting

1112
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,801
material

1113
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:21,221
that

1114
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:21,361
the

1115
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:21,863
conscious

1116
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:22,202
mind

1117
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:22,582
hasn't

1118
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:22,783
yet

1119
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:24,164
processed.

1120
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:24,607
Try

1121
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:24,827
this

1122
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:25,548
exercise.

1123
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,110
Take

1124
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:26,210
a

1125
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:26,831
character

1126
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,091
you're

1127
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:27,673
developing

1128
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:28,052
or

1129
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:28,374
even

1130
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:28,474
an

1131
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:29,174
archetype

1132
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:29,335
you

1133
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:29,535
want

1134
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:29,696
to

1135
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:30,236
explore

1136
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:30,616
and

1137
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:30,918
write

1138
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:30,977
a

1139
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:31,798
conversation

1140
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:31,979
with

1141
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,240
them.

1142
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,181
Don't

1143
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:33,601
plan

1144
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:33,782
what

1145
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:34,062
they'll

1146
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:34,363
say.

1147
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:35,465
Ask

1148
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:35,684
them

1149
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:36,285
questions.

1150
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:36,866
Why

1151
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:37,048
are

1152
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:37,187
you

1153
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:37,587
here?

1154
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:38,068
What

1155
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:38,229
do

1156
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:38,389
you

1157
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:38,789
want?

1158
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,230
What

1159
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:39,350
are

1160
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,471
you

1161
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:39,932
afraid

1162
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:40,133
of?

1163
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:40,673
Then

1164
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:40,854
let

1165
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,073
your

1166
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:41,394
hand

1167
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:41,794
move

1168
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:41,955
and

1169
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:42,196
see

1170
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:42,375
what

1171
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:43,538
emerges.

1172
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:44,163
you'll

1173
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:44,264
be

1174
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:45,004
surprised

1175
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:45,125
at

1176
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:45,306
what

1177
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:45,505
your

1178
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:46,307
unconscious

1179
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:46,708
knows

1180
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:47,129
that

1181
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:47,309
your

1182
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:47,791
conscious

1183
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,152
mind

1184
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:48,712
hasn't

1185
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:49,254
discovered

1186
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:49,494
yet.

1187
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:50,475
The

1188
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:50,976
novelist

1189
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:51,378
Toni

1190
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:51,938
Morrison

1191
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:52,460
describes

1192
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:52,860
something

1193
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,381
similar

1194
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:53,822
when

1195
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:54,423
discussing

1196
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:54,664
how

1197
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:54,904
she

1198
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:55,485
developed

1199
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:56,869
Beloved.

1200
00:09:57,085 --> 00:09:57,245
The

1201
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:57,765
character

1202
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:57,846
of

1203
00:09:57,885 --> 00:09:57,966
the

1204
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:58,307
ghost

1205
00:09:58,366 --> 00:09:58,668
child

1206
00:09:58,727 --> 00:09:58,947
didn't

1207
00:09:59,008 --> 00:09:59,188
come

1208
00:09:59,249 --> 00:09:59,369
from

1209
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:00,029
research

1210
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,169
or

1211
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,730
planning.

1212
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:01,292
She

1213
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:01,952
emerged

1214
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:02,153
from

1215
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:02,835
Morrison's

1216
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:03,655
engagement

1217
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:04,057
with

1218
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:04,197
the

1219
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:04,918
historical

1220
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:05,458
trauma

1221
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:05,599
of

1222
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,301
slavery

1223
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:06,701
and

1224
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:06,881
her

1225
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:07,462
willingness

1226
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:07,582
to

1227
00:10:07,663 --> 00:10:07,822
let

1228
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:08,003
that

1229
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:08,664
material

1230
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:09,024
speak

1231
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:09,365
through

1232
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:09,566
her.

1233
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:10,587
The

1234
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:11,009
result

1235
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:11,188
is

1236
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,288
a

1237
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:11,789
character

1238
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:11,990
who

1239
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,510
functions

1240
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,691
as

1241
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,032
more

1242
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:13,211
than

1243
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:13,292
a

1244
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:13,812
literary

1245
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:14,875
device.

1246
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:15,582
She's

1247
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:15,663
an

1248
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:16,563
archetypal

1249
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:17,504
manifestation

1250
00:10:17,544 --> 00:10:17,585
of

1251
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,306
historical

1252
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:18,785
wound

1253
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:19,267
and

1254
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:19,826
longing

1255
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:20,006
for

1256
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:20,607
connection.

1257
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:21,849
Jung

1258
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:22,570
understood

1259
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:22,769
that

1260
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:22,909
the

1261
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,770
unconscious

1262
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,150
doesn't

1263
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:24,490
speak

1264
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:24,631
in

1265
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:25,211
prose.

1266
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:25,692
It

1267
00:10:25,753 --> 00:10:26,092
speaks

1268
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:26,273
in

1269
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:26,894
symbols,

1270
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:28,235
dreams,

1271
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:29,475
myths,

1272
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:30,537
and

1273
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:31,136
creative

1274
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:31,898
inspiration

1275
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:32,339
all

1276
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:32,918

1277
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:33,058

00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:28,057
key

1487
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:28,198
is

1488
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:28,359
to

1489
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:28,759
use

1490
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,559
symbols

1491
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:30,662
authentically,

1492
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:31,643
not

1493
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:32,384
mechanically.

1494
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:33,345
Don't

1495
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:33,806
insert

1496
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:33,885
a

1497
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:34,547
forest

1498
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:35,168
because

1499
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:35,408
you've

1500
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:35,688
read

1501
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:35,889
that

1502
00:12:36,028 --> 00:12:36,549
forests

1503
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,730
are

1504
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,131
symbolic.

1505
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:38,251
But

1506
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:38,351
if

1507
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:38,552
you

1508
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:38,852
feel

1509
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:39,352
drawn

1510
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:39,474
to

1511
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:39,693
set

1512
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:39,793
a

1513
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:40,134
scene

1514
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:40,215
in

1515
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:40,335
the

1516
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:40,774
woods,

1517
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:41,937
honor

1518
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:42,197
that

1519
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:42,937
intuition

1520
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:43,298
and

1521
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:43,458
then

1522
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,080
explore

1523
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:44,340
what's

1524
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:44,659
trying

1525
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:44,801
to

1526
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,822
emerge.

1527
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,490
Your

1528
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,312
unconscious

1529
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:47,732
knows

1530
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:47,932
what

1531
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:48,094
it's

1532
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:48,534
doing.

1533
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:49,416
Here's

1534
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:49,736
Jung's

1535
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:50,177
final

1536
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:50,538
gift

1537
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:50,658
to

1538
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:51,320
creators.

1539
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:52,062
The

1540
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:52,842
concept

1541
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:53,083
of

1542
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:54,245
individuation.

1543
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:55,227
The

1544
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:55,788
process

1545
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:55,928
of

1546
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,429
becoming

1547
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,653
psychologically

1548
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:58,073
whole

1549
00:12:58,114 --> 00:12:58,715
by

1550
00:12:58,735 --> 00:12:59,416
integrating

1551
00:12:59,456 --> 00:12:59,797
all

1552
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:00,458
aspects

1553
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:00,599
of

1554
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:00,719
the

1555
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,701
psyche.

1556
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:02,599
including,

1557
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:02,918
and

1558
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:03,620
especially,

1559
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:04,160
the

1560
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:04,480

1561
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,721

1562
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:05,261
denied

1563
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:05,503
or

1564
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:06,104
rejected.

1565
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:06,945
This

1566
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:07,205
isn't

1567
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:07,445
just

1568
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:08,606
psychological

1569
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,028
theory.

1570
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:09,447
It's

1571
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:09,587
the

1572
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:10,188

00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:16,716
even

1699
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,356
frightening.

1700
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:18,318
You're

00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:38,020

You're

Paradoxically,

this

1837
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:23,120

00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:26,403
urgent.

1903
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:52,607
He

1904
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:52,908
wasn't

1905
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:53,229
trying

1906
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,328
to

1907
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:53,850
control

1908
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:54,090
them,

1909
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:54,510
he

1910
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:54,671
was

1911
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,091
learning

1912
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:55,312
their

1913
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:55,952
language.

1914
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:56,913
He

1915
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:57,073
was

1916
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:57,695
discovering

1917
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:57,855
that

1918
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:58,015
the

00:15:58,176 --> 00:15:58,917
unconscious

1920
00:15:59,297 --> 00:15:59,518
isn't

1921
00:15:59,677 --> 00:15:59,738
an

1922
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:00,219
enemy

1923
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:00,599

1924
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:00,739

1925
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:01,340
conquered

1926
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:01,721
or

1927
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:01,801
a

1928
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:02,301
servant

1929
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:02,402
to

00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:02,562
be

1931
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:03,163
commanded,

1932
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:03,943
but

1933
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:04,024
a

1934
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:04,543

1936
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:05,466
far

1937
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:06,005
older

1938
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:06,206
and

1939
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:06,847
wiser

1940
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:07,347
than

1941
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:07,488
the

1942
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:08,048
conscious

1943
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:08,710

1947
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:10,376
waiting

1948
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:10,476
in

1949
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:10,657
that

1950
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:11,238
darkness.

1951
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:12,299
Not

1952
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,419

1954
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,120
invented,

1955
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:13,301
but

1956
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:13,421

1958
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:14,302

1959
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:15,303
Your

1961
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:16,004
are

1962
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:16,466
already

1963
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:16,866
written

1964
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:17,086
in

1965
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:17,206
the

1966
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:17,727

1967
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:18,548
unconscious.

1968
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:19,791
Waiting

1969
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:19,951

1970
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,091
you

1971
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:20,171

1973
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:20,993
them

1974
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:21,393
and

1975
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:22,073
translate

1976
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:22,234
them

1977
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:22,615
for

1978
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:22,794
your

1979
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:23,216

1980
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:24,317
Your

1981
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:25,058
creativity

1982
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:25,379
isn't

1983
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:25,438
a

1984
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:25,899
personal

1985
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,441
possession.

1986
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:27,142
It's

1987
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:27,241
a

1988
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:27,802
channel

1989
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:28,202
for

1990
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:28,604
something

1991
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:29,304
universal.

1992
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:30,407
Something

1993
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:30,547
that

1994
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:30,927
connects

1995
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:31,067
you

1996
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:31,148
to

1997
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:31,548
every

1998
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:31,908
human

1999
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:32,068
who

2000
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:32,188
has

2001
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:32,450
ever

2002
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:32,690
told

2003
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:32,769
a

2004
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,171
story

2005
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:33,471
around

2006
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:33,551
a

2007
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:33,971
fire

2008
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:34,351
or

2009
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:34,712
painted

2010
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:34,832
on

2011
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:34,913

00:16:35,313 --> 00:16:36,115
wall.

2014
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:36,625
So

2015
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:37,066
dive

2016
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:37,405
deep.

2017
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:38,687
Engage

2018
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:38,868
with

2019
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:39,048
your

2020
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:39,548

2021
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:40,690
Listen

2022
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:40,809
to

2023
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:40,990
your

2024
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,691

2025
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:42,932
Trust

2026
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:43,153
your

2027
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:43,732
symbols.

2028
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:44,693
And

2029
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:45,195
remember

2030
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:45,434

00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:45,634
