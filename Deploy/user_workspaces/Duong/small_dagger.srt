1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,712
Picture this.

2
00:00:01,374 --> 00:00:02,174
It's 1407.

3
00:00:02,696 --> 00:00:07,044
You're a duke chilling at a fancy party in Paris.

4
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:10,490
Absolutely vibing with your wine and cheese.

5
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:12,695
Life is good.

6
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:15,140
You're wearing your finest robes.

7
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:20,591
Completely unaware that tonight, someone's getting real close to you.

8
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:22,815
Too close.

9
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:27,821
and before you know it, shink a tiny blade slides between your ribs and it's good game.

10
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:29,545
Game over.

11
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:31,547
No respawn.

12
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:36,194
That, my friends, is the dagger.

13
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:39,158
The medieval pocket knife of doom.

14
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:44,686
The ultimate, I'm standing right next to you and you have no idea what's about to happen weapon.

15
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,073
While swords got all the glory and Hollywood love,

16
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:56,176
The dagger was out here doing the real work silent, deadly, and absolutely no chill.

17
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:12,596
Today, we're diving into why the dagger was the iPhone of medieval weapons, compact, versatile, everyone had one, and it could absolutely end your whole career in seconds.

18
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:19,465
So buckle up, because we're about to explore the weapon that proved size doesn't always matter.

19
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:21,609
It's how you use it that counts.

20
00:01:22,652 --> 00:01:24,275
Wink, let's get the fundamentals down.

21
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:26,920
What even is a dagger?

22
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:34,094
A dagger is basically a short blade, usually between 6 to 20 inches, designed for stabbing.

23
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:36,278
Not slashing like your anime swords.

24
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:37,819
Stabbing.

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,501
Big difference.

26
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:43,828
Think of it like the difference between a foam finger and a pencil.

27
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,371
One makes noise at sports games.

28
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:49,676
The other goes straight through your notebook.

29
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,037
The dagger.

30
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:52,260
It's the pencil.

31
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:56,185
Now, here's the thing that made daggers absolutely cracked.

32
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:57,727
They were everywhere.

33
00:01:58,769 --> 00:01:59,769
Knights had them.

34
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:01,972
Peasants had them.

35
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:04,367
merchants had them tucked in their boots.

36
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,393
Even priests sometimes had them, you know?

37
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:16,387
For self-defense and totally not stabbing heretics, it was the medieval equivalent of everyone having a smartphone.

38
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,069
Universal.

39
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,572
Essential.

40
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:25,181
And honestly, kind of sus that everyone was just walking around armed like that.

41
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:29,427
The beauty of the dagger was its versatility.

42
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,354
Your sword breaks in battle, dagger time.

43
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:34,301
Someone gets past your guard, dagger time.

44
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:37,069
Need to eat dinner, believe it or not.

45
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:41,021
Also, dagger time, these things doubled as utensils.

46
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:47,122
Medieval people were really out here cutting their steak with the same blade they'd used to un-alive someone.

47
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:49,165
Talk about multitasking.

48
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:52,691
Not all daggers were created equal.

49
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,455
Though, oh no.

50
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:59,901
Medieval armorsmith said let's get creative and went wild.

51
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:03,246
First up, the Rondell dagger.

52
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:09,076
This bad boy had a disc-shaped guard and pommel, hence rondelle, from the French word for circle.

53
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,381
But here's where it gets spicy.

54
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:15,489
The blade was specifically designed to punch through armor.

55
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,343
Remember, this is the era when knights were walking around in full-metal suits like medieval Iron Man.

56
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:27,867
The Rondle Dagger was the ultimate, your armor means nothing to me weapon.

57
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:37,737
It had a stiff, narrow blade that could slide into the gaps between plates, the armpits, the visor, the joints.

58
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:45,324
Basically, it found every weak spot in armor, like a medieval hacker finding bugs in code.

59
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:47,627
Then we have the Balak Dagger.

60
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:49,128
Yes.

61
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:50,598
That's the real name.

62
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:51,840
Yes.

63
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:58,627
Medieval people named it that because, well, look at it.

64
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:08,419
The handle has two rounded lobes at the base that resemble a certain part of male anatomy.

65
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:12,264
Medieval humor was unhinged.

66
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:22,324
But don't let the goofy name fool you, this was a serious weapon, popular from the 13th to the 16th century, especially in England and Scandinavia.

67
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:30,220
And we can't forget the stiletto, the Italian contribution to the how can we make stabbing more efficient conversation.

68
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,867
Pure piercing power, slim profile, literally designed with one job getting through chainmail.

69
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:44,252
If the stiletto had a resume, it would just say, I penetrate armor and drop the mic.

70
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:50,838
Now let's talk about how these things were actually used, because Hollywood has lied to you.

71
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:58,165
In movies, daggers are always these sneaky assassin weapons used in shadows.

72
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,610
And sure, that happened.

73
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:04,576
But daggers were also standard battlefield equipment.

74
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:08,002
Every single night carried one as backup.

75
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:09,163
Why?

76
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,747
Because medieval combat was messy.

77
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,312
Imagine this, you're in a battle.

78
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:16,555
Swords are clashing.

79
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:18,519
People are yelling.

80
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,245
Someone's horse just knocked you over.

81
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:26,052
and suddenly you're wrestling some dude in full armor on the ground.

82
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:30,098
This is called grappling, and it happened all the time.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,985
Your sword, useless at this range.

84
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:35,528
Too long.

85
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:37,112
Too awkward.

86
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,406
but you're dagger perfect.

87
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:45,656
You'd literally be trying to find gaps in your opponent's armor while he's doing the same to you.

88
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,184
It's like the world's most violent and stressful game of operation.

89
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:55,793
Knights even had a technique called the Mercy Stroke, or coup de grâce.

90
00:05:56,177 --> 00:06:05,252
After a battle, victorious knights would walk around the battlefield and use their daggers to quickly end the suffering of mortally wounded enemies.

91
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,656
Dark, absolutely.

92
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:11,262
But also considered merciful by medieval standards.

93
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:18,473
Hey, I'm going to stab you so you don't die slowly was basically compassion back then.

94
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:20,278
Medieval times were brutal.

95
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,706
But okay.

96
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,432
Let's address the elephant in the room.

97
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:25,276
Yes.

98
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,454
Daggers were absolutely the weapon of choice for assassinations.

99
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:32,254
And there's a very good reason why.

100
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:33,875
Concealment.

101
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:36,057
That's the secret sauce.

102
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,541
Try hiding a longsword under your cloak.

103
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:40,802
Go ahead.

104
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:42,725
Everyone's gonna notice.

105
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:46,649
But a dagger slides right into your belt.

106
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:48,451
Your boot.

107
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:51,254
Your sleeve if you're feeling spicy.

108
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:54,338
You could walk right up to someone at a feast.

109
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,661
A market.

110
00:06:56,641 --> 00:07:01,427
a church anywhere and they'd have no idea you were armed until it was too late.

111
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:05,432
Medieval Europe had some wild assassinations.

112
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:12,461
The Duke of Orléans I mentioned earlier stabbed to death in Paris by hired killers with daggers.

113
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,346
Several popes were nearly assassinated with daggers.

114
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,749
Even kings weren't safe.

115
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,913
The dagger was the great equalizer.

116
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:25,617
Didn't matter how much armor you wore to bed, yes,

117
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,504
Some paranoid nobles actually did this.

118
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:33,161
A skilled assassin with a dagger could find a way.

119
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:37,194
There's also something psychological about it.

120
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:39,350
A dagger killing is personal.

121
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:45,877
You're literally face to face with someone, close enough to smell their last meal.

122
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,942
Archers could kill from a distance.

123
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,505
Swordsmen could strike from a few feet away.

124
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:56,891
But dagger wielders, they, were right there.

125
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:01,357
It takes a special kind of cold to use a dagger for murder.

126
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:06,202
And medieval assassins had ice in their veins.

127
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,615
Here's something wild, daggers became status symbols.

128
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:18,346
Rich nobles would commission elaborate daggers with jeweled handles, gold inlay, intricate engravings.

129
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:22,350
These weren't just weapons, they were medieval flex culture.

130
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,555
Walking around with a fancy dagger was like pulling up in a Lambo.

131
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:31,961
Oh, this old thing, just my everyday murder knife that cost more than your house.

132
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:35,784
Different regions developed their own styles too.

133
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:40,811
The Scottish had their sea and dube, that little knife they still wear with kilts today.

134
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:43,495
The Spanish had their stilettos.

135
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:50,163
The English loved their Balak daggers, despite the... unfortunate name.

136
00:08:51,124 --> 00:09:00,115
Every culture was like, okay, but our stabbing knife is superior and, honestly, the dedication to knife culture is kind of impressive.

137
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:03,779
Daggers also showed up in judicial duels.

138
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,024
Yeah.

139
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:11,173
Medieval people settled legal disputes by trying to kill each other-based legal system.

140
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:17,582
Honestly, sometimes these duels were fought with sword and dagger combos.

141
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:23,913
The dagger served as both an offhand defensive weapon and a finishing tool.

142
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:29,802
Imagine losing your court case because you brought a knife to a

143
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:31,703
Wait.

144
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:33,866
Everyone brought knives.

145
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:38,232
Imagine losing because your knife game was weak.

146
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,855
So why should we care about daggers today?

147
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:47,644
What's the historical significance that dagger represents something fundamental about human conflict efficiency?

148
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:50,649
It wasn't flashy.

149
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:54,534
It didn't have the romance of the sword or the devastating power of the mace.

150
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:56,197
But it worked.

151
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:57,960
It was practical.

152
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,462
Accessible.

153
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:01,985
and deadly effective.

154
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:12,427
The dagger democratized violence in a weird way a peasant with a dagger could theoretically take down a knight if they got lucky or skilled enough.

155
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:16,471
It also shows us that medieval people were constantly innovating.

156
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:22,216
Every new type of armor led to a new type of dagger designed to defeat it.

157
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:27,942
It's an arms race in miniature, playing out over centuries.

158
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:32,386
The rondelle dagger exists because plate armor got too good.

159
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:36,831
The stiletto exists because chainmail was too effective.

160
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:41,537
It's evolution, but make it stabby.

161
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:45,244
and culturally, the dagger's legacy is everywhere.

162
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:47,508
Every movie assassin.

163
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,613
Every video game rogue class.

164
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:53,197
Every stealth kill mechanic.

165
00:10:53,778 --> 00:11:00,451
It all traces back to the medieval dagger and its reputation as the weapon of shadows and silence.

166
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:01,793
Look.

167
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,538
At the end of the day,

168
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:08,041
The dagger was never going to win any popularity contests.

169
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:21,974
Swords got the songs, the legends, the cool names like Excalibur, daggers just got the job done quietly, efficiently, and with zero fanfare.

170
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:24,696
But that's exactly what made them special.

171
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:34,524
In a world obsessed with honor, glory, and flashy combat, the dagger said, yeah, but what if we just

172
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:38,861
One, it was the weapon that understood the assignment.

173
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:41,371

The medieval dagger reminds us that sometimes the most important tools aren't the most celebrated ones.

178
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,278
Sometimes the real MVPs are the ones doing the work nobody wants to talk about at parties.

179
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:10,788
So next time you see a dagger in a museum or a movie, give it some respect.

Crossbow's Maces, the terrifyingly bonkers flail.

185

Until next time, stay sharp.

186
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,206
But maybe not dagger sharp.

187
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,133
That's a bit much.
