It's

5
00:00:02,696 --> 00:00:03,157
You're

Absolutely

24
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:12,695
good.

25
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:13,696
You're

Completely

46
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:23,815

56
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,181
it's

57
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:27,501
good

58
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:27,821
game.

59
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:29,064
Game

No

That,

00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:33,951
my

65
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:34,311

69
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:37,276
The

74
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:39,158
doom.

75
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:40,280
The

76
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:40,680
ultimate,

77
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:41,021
I'm

00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:42,442
you

85
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:42,664

86
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:43,024

88
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:43,784

00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:44,386
happen

92
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:44,686
weapon.

93
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:45,807
While

94
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:46,228

95
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:46,429

glory

99
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:47,390

100
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:47,970
Hollywood

101
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,073
love,

102
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:49,347
The

103
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:49,728
dagger

104
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:49,908
was

105
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:50,109
out

106
00:00:50,168 --> 00:00:50,409
here

107
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:50,689
doing

108
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:50,810

real

110
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:51,490
work

111
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:52,031
silent,

112
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:53,453
deadly,

113
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:54,554
and

114
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:55,475
absolutely

115
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:55,795
no

116
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:56,176
chill.

117
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:57,438
Today,

118
00:00:57,497 --> 00:00:58,579
we're

119
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:58,979
diving

120
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,301
into

121
00:00:59,341 --> 00:00:59,720
why

122
00:00:59,780 --> 00:00:59,881
the

123
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,341
dagger

124
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:00,722
was

125
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:00,902
the

126
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:01,582
iPhone

127
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:01,804
of

128
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:02,323
medieval

129
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:02,804
weapons,

130
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:04,466
compact,

131
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:06,009
versatile,

132
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:07,510
everyone

133
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,152
had

134
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:08,432
one,

135
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:09,373
and

136
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:09,433
it

137
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:09,612
could

138
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:10,293
absolutely

139
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:10,575
end

140
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:10,754
your

141
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:10,995
whole

142
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:11,436
career

143
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:11,695
in

144
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:12,596
seconds.

145
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:13,293
So

146
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:13,774
buckle

147
00:01:13,894 --> 00:01:13,993
up,

148
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:15,075
because

149
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:15,316
we're

150
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:15,596
about

151
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:15,757
to

152
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:16,299
explore

153
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:16,438
the

154
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:16,840
weapon

155
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:17,221
that

156
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,682
proved

157
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:18,222
size

158
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:18,623
doesn't

159
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:19,043
always

160
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:19,465
matter.

161
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:20,046
It's

162
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:20,287
how

163
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:20,507
you

164
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:20,847
use

165
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:20,947
it

166
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:21,209
that

167
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:21,609
counts.

168
00:01:22,652 --> 00:01:23,031
Wink,

169
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:23,212
let's

170
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:23,332
get

171
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:23,433
the

172
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:23,974
fundamentals

173
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:24,275
down.

174
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:25,257
What

175
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:25,597
even

176
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:25,957
is

177
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:26,019
a

178
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:26,920
dagger?

179
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:27,581
A

180
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:27,962
dagger

181
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:28,143
is

182
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:28,644
basically

183
00:01:28,664 --> 00:01:28,683
a

184
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:29,125
short

185
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:29,605
blade,

186
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:30,307
usually

187
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:30,647
between

188
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:31,009
6

189
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:31,149

190
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:31,469
20

191
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,870
inches,

192
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,632
designed

193
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:32,811
for

194
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,094
stabbing.

195
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:34,355
Not

196
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:34,915
slashing

197
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:35,296
like

198
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:35,477
your

199
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:35,918
anime

200
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:36,278
swords.

201
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:37,819
Stabbing.

202
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:38,981
Big

203
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:39,501
difference.

204
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:40,724
Think

205
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:40,804
of

206
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:40,924
it

207
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:41,125
like

208
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:41,265
the

209
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:41,745
difference

210
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:42,146
between

211
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:42,206
a

212
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:42,626

00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:43,066
finger

214
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:43,308
and

215
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:43,388
a

216
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:43,828
pencil.

217

One

00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:49,215

00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:51,679
It's

00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:51,799
the

235
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:53,381
Now,

236
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,721

243
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:56,185
cracked.

244
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:56,805
They

245
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:57,025

00:01:58,769 --> 00:01:59,108
Knights

249
00:01:59,609 --> 00:01:59,769

262
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:06,751

00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:08,395
For

00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:09,256
self-defense

269
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:09,796

270
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:10,358

271
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:10,737

Essential.

00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:55,153
oh

367
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:55,455

creative

374
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,039
and

375
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,280
went

376
00:02:59,461 --> 00:02:59,901
wild.

377
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:01,082
First

378
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:01,282
up,

379
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:01,563
the

382
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:03,526
This

383
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:03,787
bad

384
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:04,048

391
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:06,532
hence

392
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:07,313
rondelle,

393
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:07,754
from

399
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:10,118
But

400
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:10,379
here's

401
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:10,539

402
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:10,620
it

403
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:10,819
gets

404
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:11,381
spicy.

405
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:11,942
The

00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:13,365
specifically

armor.

414
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:16,711
Remember,

415
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:17,712
this

416
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:17,854
is

417
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:18,014

backup.

644
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:09,163
Why?

645
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:10,045
Because

646
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:10,565
medieval

647
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:11,086
combat

648
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:11,266
was

649
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:11,747
messy.

650
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:13,050
Imagine

651
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,271
this,

652
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:13,750
you're

653
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:13,891
in

654
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:13,951
a

655
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:14,312
battle.

656
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:15,714
Swords

657
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:15,954
are

658
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:16,555
clashing.

659
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:17,877
People

660
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:18,137
are

661
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:18,519
yelling.

662
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:19,920
Someone's

663
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,281
horse

664
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:20,622
just

665
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:20,983
knocked

666
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,142
you

667
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:22,245
over.

668
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:22,485
and

669
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:23,005
suddenly

670
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:23,247
you're

671
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:23,767
wrestling

672
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:24,108
some

673
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:24,389
dude

674
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:24,588
in

675
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:24,990
full

676
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,411
armor

677
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:25,591
on

678
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:25,690
the

679
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,052
ground.

680
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:27,173
This

681
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:27,314
is

682
00:05:27,353 --> 00:05:27,595
called

683
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:28,216
grappling,

684
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:28,576
and

685
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:28,656
it

686
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:29,057
happened

687
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:29,577
all

688
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:29,759
the

689
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:30,098
time.

690
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,300
Your

691
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:31,841
sword,

692
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,064
useless

693
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:33,324
at

694
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:33,565
this

695
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:33,985
range.

696
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:35,168
Too

697
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:35,528
long.

698
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:36,610
Too

699
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,112
awkward.

700
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:38,045
but

701
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:38,286
you're

702
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:38,685
dagger

703
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:39,406
perfect.

704
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:40,588
You'd

705
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:41,129
literally

706
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,290
be

707
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,591
trying

708
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:41,690
to

709
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:41,971
find

710
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:42,411
gaps

711
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:42,552
in

712
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:42,713
your

713
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:43,192
opponent's

714
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:43,634
armor

715
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:44,214
while

716
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:44,555
he's

717
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:44,836
doing

718
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:44,975
the

719
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:45,237
same

720
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:45,396
to

721
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:45,656
you.

722
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:46,738
It's

723
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:46,978
like

724
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:47,098
the

725
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,480
world's

726
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,740
most

727
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,261
violent

728
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:48,482
and

729
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,062
stressful

730
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:49,382
game

731
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:49,543
of

732
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:50,184
operation.

733
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:51,425
Knights

734
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:51,747
even

735
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:51,927
had

736
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:52,007
a

737
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:52,548
technique

738
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:52,968
called

739
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:53,088
the

740
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:53,550
Mercy

741
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,170
Stroke,

742
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,271
or

743
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:54,630
coup

744
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:54,771
de

745
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,793
grâce.

746
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:56,579
After

747
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:56,678
a

748
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:57,059
battle,

749
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:58,442
victorious

750
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:58,802
knights

751
00:05:58,901 --> 00:05:59,021
would

752
00:05:59,083 --> 00:05:59,302
walk

753
00:05:59,362 --> 00:05:59,562
around

754
00:05:59,603 --> 00:05:59,684
the

755
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:00,264
battlefield

756
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:00,704
and

757
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:00,985
use

758
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:01,206
their

759
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:01,706
daggers

760
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:02,127
to

761
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:02,567
quickly

762
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:02,928
end

763
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:03,149
the

764
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:03,730
suffering

765
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:03,910
of

766
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:04,430
mortally

767
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:04,831
wounded

768
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:05,252
enemies.

769
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:06,553
Dark,

770
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:07,656
absolutely.

771
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:08,637
But

772
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:09,038
also

773
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:09,598
considered

774
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:10,160
merciful

775
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,360
by

776
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:10,800
medieval

777
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:11,262
standards.

778
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:12,543
Hey,

779
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:13,644
I'm

780
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:13,886
going

781
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:13,985
to

782
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:14,326
stab

783
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:14,487
you

784
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:14,666
so

785
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:14,826
you

786
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:15,067
don't

787
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:15,348
die

788
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:15,889
slowly

789
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:16,449
was

790
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:16,911
basically

791
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:17,490
compassion

792
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:17,732
back

793
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:18,473
then.

794
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:19,235
Medieval

795
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:19,576
times

796
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:19,797
were

797
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:20,278
brutal.

798
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:21,341
But

799
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:22,706
okay.

800
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:22,908
Let's

801
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:23,309
address

802
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:23,490
the

803
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:23,951
elephant

804
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,052
in

805
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:24,151
the

806
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:24,432
room.

807
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:25,276
Yes.

808
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:26,701
Daggers

809
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:27,141
were

810
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:27,805
absolutely

811
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:27,964
the

812
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:28,307
weapon

813
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:28,387
of

814
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:28,827
choice

815
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:29,048
for

816
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:30,454
assassinations.

817
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:30,872
And

818
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,072
there's

819
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:31,151
a

820
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:31,432
very

821
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:31,632
good

822
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:31,913
reason

823
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:32,254
why.

824
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:33,875
Concealment.

825
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:35,117
That's

826
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:35,257
the

827
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:35,617
secret

828
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:36,057
sauce.

829
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:37,278
Try

830
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:37,660
hiding

831
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:37,699
a

832
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,581
longsword

833
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:38,961
under

834
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,161
your

835
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:39,541
cloak.

836
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:40,523
Go

837
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:40,802
ahead.

838
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:42,165
Everyone's

839
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:42,365
gonna

840
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:42,725
notice.

841
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:43,747
But

842
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:43,826
a

843
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:44,367
dagger

844
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:45,408
slides

845
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:45,749
right

846
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:46,149
into

847
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:46,329
your

848
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:46,649
belt.

849
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:47,951
Your

850
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:48,451
boot.

851
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:49,632
Your

852
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:50,134
sleeve

853
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:50,293
if

854
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:50,473
you're

855
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:50,774
feeling

856
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:51,254
spicy.

857
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:52,295
You

858
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:52,456

859
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:52,716

872
00:06:58,103 --> 00:06:58,163
and

873
00:06:58,202 --> 00:06:58,362
they'd

874
00:06:58,423 --> 00:06:58,543

880
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:00,685

881
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:00,786
it

882
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:00,925

883
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:01,146

00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:01,427

Several

915
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:17,567
Even

917
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:18,348

equalizer.

925
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:22,553
Didn't

926
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:22,814
matter

927
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:23,055

Some

940
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:28,504

951
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:34,404
There's

personal.

962
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:40,471
You're

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,072

Archers

977
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:47,439

Swordsmen

These

1180
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:25,596
Imagine

00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:26,417

00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,058

00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:28,399

00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:31,703
Wait.

1193
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:33,105
Everyone

1194
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:33,385
brought

1195
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:33,866
knives.

1196
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:35,308
Imagine

00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:35,788
losing

1198
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,169

1203
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:38,232
weak.

1204
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:38,393
So

1205
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:38,633
why

1206
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:38,873
should

00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:39,033

1209
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:39,735
about

1210
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:40,274
daggers

1211
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:40,855
today?

1212
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:41,336
What's

1213
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:41,476
the

1214
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:42,197
historical

1215
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:42,938
significance

1216
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:43,379
that

1217
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,820
dagger

1218
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,480
represents

1219
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:44,902
something

1220
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:45,702
fundamental

1221
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:46,062
about

1222
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:46,484
human

1223
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:47,024

1224
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:47,644
efficiency?

1225
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:48,807
It

1226
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:49,187
wasn't

1227
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:50,649
flashy.

1228
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:50,730
It

1229
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:51,009
didn't

1230
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,230
have

1231
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,350
the

1232
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:51,750
romance

1233
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:51,831
of

1234
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:51,951
the

1235
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:52,371
sword

1236
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:52,793
or

1237
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:52,913
the

1238
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:53,533
devastating

1239
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:53,913
power

1240
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:54,053
of

1241
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:54,193
the

1242
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:54,534
mace.

1243
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:55,615
But

1244
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:55,736
it

1245
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:56,197
worked.

1246
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:57,259
It

1247
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:57,418
was

1248
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:57,960
practical.

1249
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,462
Accessible.

1250
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:00,783
and

1251
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:01,264
deadly

1252
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:01,985
effective.

1253
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:03,067
The

1254
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:03,528
dagger

1255
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,672
democratized

1256
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:05,212
violence

1257
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:05,653

1258
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:05,714
a

1259
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:06,054
weird

1260
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:06,355
way

1261
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:06,394
a

1262
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:07,017
peasant

1263
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:07,197
with

1264
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:07,277
a

1265
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:07,738
dagger

1266
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:08,178
could

1267
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:08,799
theoretically

1268
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,100
take

1269
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,361
down

1270
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:09,461
a

1271
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:09,783
knight

1272
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:10,182
if

1273
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:10,344
they

1274
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:10,543
got

1275
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:10,924

00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:57,827
ones.

1485
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,370
Sometimes

1486
00:11:59,471 --> 00:11:59,571
the

1487
00:11:59,671 --> 00:11:59,932

1490
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:01,193
the

1491
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:01,474
ones

1492
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:01,815
doing

1493
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:01,914
the

1494
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:02,195
work

1495
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:02,676
nobody

1496
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:02,956
wants

1497
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:03,096
to

1498
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:03,356

1501
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:04,278
parties.

1502
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:05,480
So

1503
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:05,701
next

1504
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:05,900
time

1505
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:06,041
you

1506
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:06,221
see

1507
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:06,302
a

1508
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:06,743
dagger

1509
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:06,903
in

1510
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:06,942
a

1511
00:12:07,003 --> 00:12:07,443
museum

1512
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:07,683
or

1513
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:07,764
a

1514
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:08,184
movie,

1515
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:09,226
give

1516
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:09,326
it

1517
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:09,547
some

1518
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:10,788
respect.

1519
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:11,259
That

1520
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:11,559
little

1521
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:11,980
blade

1522
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:12,221
has

1523
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,662
ended

1524
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:13,383
dynasties,

1525
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:14,784
changed

1526
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:15,326
history,

1527
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:16,307
and

1528
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:16,748
scared

1529
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:16,868
the

1530
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:17,448
absolute

1531
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:18,009
crap

1532
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:18,431
out

1533
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:18,510
of

1534
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:19,011
medieval

1535
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:19,432
nobles

1536
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:19,793
trying

1537
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:19,893
to

1538
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:20,193
sleep

1539
00:12:20,254 --> 00:12:20,293
at

1540
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:20,514
night.

1541
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:21,495
And

1542
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:21,735
hey,

1543
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:22,878
if

1544
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:23,077
you

1545
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:23,359
learned

1546
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:23,739
something

1547
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,080
today,

1548
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:25,542

1549
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:25,783

1550
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:26,043
like

1551
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:26,403
button

1552
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:26,803
harder

1553
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:26,945
than

1554
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:27,044
a

1555
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:27,605
rondel

1556
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,046
dagger

1557
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:28,407
through

1558
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:28,788
plate

1559
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:29,148
armor.

Subscribe

1561

1562
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,191
more

1563
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:31,772
medieval

1564
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,173
weapon

1565
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:32,494
deep

1566
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:33,434
dives.

1567
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:33,990
And

1568
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:34,251
drop

1569
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:34,331
a

1570
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:34,712
comment,

1571
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:35,033
what

1572
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:35,515
weapon

1573
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:35,817
should

1574
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:35,937
we

1575
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:36,258
cover

1576
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:36,639
next?

1577
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,601
Crossbow's

1578
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:38,043
Maces,

1579
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:38,565
the

1580
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,346
terrifyingly

1581
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:39,928
bonkers

1582
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:40,389
flail.

1583
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:41,152
Until

1584
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:41,373
next

1585
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:41,634
time,

1586
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:42,878
stay

1587
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:43,259
sharp.

1588
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:44,842
But

1589
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:45,163
maybe

1590
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:45,365
not

1591
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:45,826
dagger

1592
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:46,206
sharp.

1593
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,311
That's

1594
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,390
a

1595
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:47,611
bit

1596
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:48,133
much.
