00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,035
Hello and welcome back to Synchro.

2
00:00:02,716 --> 00:00:05,120
Think about the last job interview you had.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:20,908
You probably tried to present yourself as outgoing, energetic, a team player who thrives in collaborative environments, even if you're someone who does their best thinking alone, even if small talk drains you.

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:32,134
Even if you'd rather spend your lunch break reading than networking, we've been taught that success, especially in our careers, belongs to the extroverts.

5
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:41,945
But what if everything you've been told about introversion and extroversion is not just wrong, but actively harming your career potential?

6
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:47,993
Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist who first coined these terms.

7
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:54,189
had a radically different understanding of what introversion and extroversion actually mean.

8
00:00:54,932 --> 00:01:08,158
And more importantly, he understood how each type, when properly leveraged, possesses unique strengths that can lead to extraordinary professional success today.

9
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:23,784
We're going deep into Jungian typology to understand not just what your type is, but how to use it strategically to build a career that doesn't drain you, but energizes you by the end of this video.

10
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:30,150
You'll understand why forcing yourself to be someone you're not is the worst career strategy possible.

11
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:39,253
And how aligning your work with your psychological type can unlock levels of success and satisfaction you didn't know were possible.

12
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:41,317
Let's dive in.

13
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:53,584
Before we can leverage your Jungian type, we need to understand what Jung actually meant by introversion and extroversion, because it's probably not what you think.

14
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:59,290
In popular culture, these terms have been reduced to simple social preferences.

15
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:02,715
Extroverts are outgoing and talkative.

16
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:05,459
Introverts are shy and quiet.

17
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,481
But Jung's original concept was far more sophisticated and far more useful for career development.

18
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:14,487
for Jung.

19
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:21,614
Introversion and extroversion weren't about social skills or preference for parties versus solitude.

20
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:26,299
They were about the fundamental orientation of your psychic energy.

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,064
They described where you naturally direct your attention and from where you draw your vitality.

22
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:42,895
Jung wrote that the introvert's interest flows inward toward the subject, toward their own internal psychological processes, ideas.

23
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:45,997
impressions and reactions.

24
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:54,228
The introvert is oriented primarily toward the inner world of thoughts, feelings, and reflections.

25
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:05,864
Their energy moves from the outer world inward, where it gets processed, contemplated, and given meaning before any outward action occurs.

26
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:17,901
The extrovert, by contrast, has their interest flowing outward toward the object, toward people, things, and external events.

27
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:26,775
The extrovert is oriented primarily toward the outer world of action, interaction, and tangible reality.

28
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:36,522
Their energy moves from inner experience outward finding expression and vitality through engagement with external environment.

29
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,966
Notice what Jung isn't saying.

30
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:45,073
He's not saying introverts hate people or that extroverts can't think deeply.

31
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:49,979
He's describing the natural flow of psychic energy and attention.

32
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,985
An introvert can be socially skilled, charismatic even.

33
00:03:55,657 --> 00:04:00,521
but they'll need time alone afterward to process the experience internally.

34
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:11,493
An extrovert can engage in deep reflection, but they'll often need to talk through their thoughts with others or take action to fully understand what they're thinking.

35
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:24,447
This distinction is crucial for your career because it determines what kinds of work environments, tasks, and roles will energize you versus drain you.

36
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:26,471
Let's make this concrete with an example.

37
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:31,362
Consider two marketing professionals, David and Jennifer.

38
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:33,307
David is an introvert.

39
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:43,836
He does his best creative work when he can research deeply, develop comprehensive strategies, and refine his ideas before presenting them.

40
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:49,706
He's excellent in one-on-one client meetings where depth of relationship matters.

41
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:58,603
He's the person who sends the follow-up email that perfectly captures what was discussed and moves the project forward.

42
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:04,283
His presentations are thoroughly prepared, insightful, and impactful.

43
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:07,569
Jennifer is an extrovert.

44
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:15,182
She generates her best ideas in brainstorming sessions, bouncing concepts off colleagues in real time.

45
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:22,204
She's energized by client calls, networking events, and collaborative workshops.

46
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:32,235
She thinks out loud, tests ideas through conversation and adapts quickly based on immediate feedback.

47
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:38,862
Her presentations are dynamic, responsive to the room, and create immediate engagement.

48
00:05:39,543 --> 00:06:02,468
Both are excellent at marketing, but they're leveraging completely different cognitive and energetic processes The tragedy is that many organizations only recognize and reward Jennifer's style, leaving talented introverts like David feeling inadequate or trying to force themselves into an extroverted mold that depletes them.

49
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:05,651
Here's the key insight that Young emphasized.

50
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:07,994
Neither type is superior.

51
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:13,139
Each has profound strengths and inevitable limitations.

52
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:23,588
The question isn't which type is better for your career, but how to structure your career around your type's natural strengths while managing its weaknesses.

53
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:28,232
Let's explore the specific career advantages of each type.

54
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,535
Starting with introversion.

55
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:38,122
Young observe that introverts excel at depth over breadth because their energy flows inward.

56
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:41,946
They're naturally inclined towards sustained focus.

57
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:46,942
complex problem solving and developing expertise.

58
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:58,791
They're often the people who become true masters of their craft because they're willing to spend hours, days, years going deep into their subject matter.

59
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:11,764
In practical career terms, this means introverts often excel in roles requiring specialized knowledge, strategic thinking and independent work.

60
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:27,536
research scientists, software developers, writers, analysts, financial planners, architects, and academic researchers are fields where introverted strengths shine.

61
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:30,761
But it's not limited to solitary professions.

62
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:44,233
Many successful executives, lawyers, And consultants are introverts who've learned to leverage their natural inclination toward careful analysis and thoughtful decision making.

63
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:51,892
Introverts also tend to be excellent listeners, which is an underrated career superpower.

64
00:07:52,192 --> 00:08:04,911
While an extrovert might be formulating their response while you're talking, the introvert is genuinely taking in what you're saying, processing it, and forming a considered response.

65
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:13,084
This makes them exceptional counselors, coaches, interviewers, and advisors.

66
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:20,935
People feel heard and understood, which builds deep professional relationships and trust.

67
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:27,372
Another advantage is that introverts are less dependent on external validation for their motivation.

68
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:34,100
They're driven more by internal standards of excellence and personal satisfaction with their work.

69
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:42,169
This can lead to more sustainable career satisfaction because they're not constantly seeking approval or recognition from others.

70
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,998
They can weather periods where their contributions aren't immediately visible or celebrated.

71
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:53,214
However, introverts face predictable career challenges.

72
00:08:54,216 --> 00:09:03,946
They may struggle with self-promotion, networking events, and making their accomplishments visible in organizations that reward vocal participation.

73
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:12,855
They might be overlooked for leadership roles because they don't fit the stereotypical image of the charismatic, outgoing leader.

74
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:17,600
They can experience burnout in environments with constant meetings.

75
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:23,360
open plan offices, and expectation of immediate responsiveness.

76
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,984
Now, let's look at extroverted strengths.

77
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:34,852
Jung noted that extroverts excel at breadth over depth, because their energy flows outward.

78
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:42,961
They're naturally inclined toward building networks, generating ideas through interaction and taking action.

79
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:50,307
They're energized by variety, stimulation, and engagement with people and projects.

80
00:09:51,210 --> 00:10:11,144
In career terms, extroverts often thrive in roles requiring relationship building, communication, and dynamic problem solving, sales, business development, public relations, teaching, event management, hospitality,

81
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:16,514
and entrepreneurship are fields where extroverted strengths shine.

82
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:19,256
But again, it's not limited.

83
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:33,972
Many successful researchers, engineers, and analysts are extroverts who leverage their ability to collaborate, share ideas, and build teams around their work.

84
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:39,899
Extroverts are typically skilled at networking, not in a superficial way.

85
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:45,388
but because they're genuinely energized by meeting new people and exploring connections.

86
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:50,793
This creates career opportunities that might never appear on job boards.

87
00:10:51,855 --> 00:11:01,866
They hear about positions through their network, get introductions to key decision makers, and build relationships that open doors throughout their career.

88
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:08,875
Another advantage is that extroverts tend to be comfortable with visibility and self-promotion.

89
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:13,884
They can articulate their ideas and accomplishments without feeling like they're bragging.

90
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:22,293
In organizational settings, this means their work gets noticed, their top of mind for new opportunities.

91
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:26,580
And they're often perceived as leadership material.

92
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:33,207
Extroverts also excel at thinking on their feet and adapting to changing circumstances.

93
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,254
They process information through external engagement.

94
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:47,595
which means they can handle dynamic situations, pivot strategies in real time, and respond to feedback immediately.

95
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:53,140
This is invaluable in fast-paced environments and crisis situations.

96
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:57,485
However, extroverts face their own challenges.

97
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:11,629
They may struggle with roles requiring extended periods of solitary, focused work, they might find it difficult to develop deep expertise because they're drawn to variety and new experiences.

98
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:18,438
They can make hasty decisions because their bias is toward action rather than reflection.

99
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:27,750
They might also experience burnout in environments that are too isolated or where they lack opportunities for collaboration and interaction.

100
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:31,917
Here's where Jung's insight becomes career changing.

101
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:35,909
The goal isn't to overcome your type, but to leverage it.

102
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:37,951
This means three things.

103
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:44,077
First, choosing roles and environments that align with your type's strengths.

104
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,283
Second, developing strategies to manage your type's challenges.

105
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:58,831
Third, understanding that you can access your non-preferred orientation when needed, but it will cost more energy.

106
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:00,590
Let's start with role selection.

107
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:11,508
If you're an introvert, look for positions that allow for deep work, independent projects, and meaningful one-on-one interactions.

108
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:18,078
This doesn't mean avoiding all teamwork or client contact, but ensuring these aren't constant.

109
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,346
Look for organizations that value written communication.

110
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:25,730
Give time for thoughtful responses.

111
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:28,774
and don't mistake quiet for disengagement.

112
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:40,431
Consider roles like research analyst, technical specialist, strategic planner, content creator, or backend developer.

113
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:46,500
Even in traditionally extroverted fields, look for the introverted niches.

114
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:53,811
In sales, consider technical sales where product expertise matters more than schmoozing.

115
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:54,738
in management.

116
00:13:55,477 --> 00:14:00,802
Consider project management or operations roles rather than business development.

117
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:10,049
If you're an extrovert, look for positions with variety, interaction, and opportunities to think through conversation.

118
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:18,618
Seek organizations with collaborative cultures, open communication, and value for relationship building.

119
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:34,898
Consider roles like account manager, business development, team leader, trainer, recruiter, or consultant, even in traditionally introverted fields, find the extroverted angles.

120
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,304
In software development, consider product management or developer relations.

121
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:53,076
In research, consider roles involving collaboration, presentation, or translation of technical findings for broader audiences.

122
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:56,182
Now let's talk about managing your challenges.

123
00:14:57,124 --> 00:15:02,491
If you're an introvert, your biggest career liability is often invisibility.

124
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,937
You might do excellent work that no one knows about.

125
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:12,527
The solution isn't to become an extrovert, but to create systems for visibility.

126
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:19,096
Schedule regular one-on-one updates with your manager where you can discuss your work in depth.

127
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:24,672
Document your contributions in writing where you're more comfortable articulating your value.

128
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:30,160
Choose one or two networking events per quarter rather than trying to attend everything.

129
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:36,192
Prepare specific talking points about your projects so you're not caught off guard.

130
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:41,613
Find an extroverted mentor or colleague who can help advocate for your work.

131
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:48,461
Another challenge for introverts is the energy drain of excessive meetings and collaboration.

132
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:51,706
Build boundaries around your deep work time.

133
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:55,451
Block off your calendar for focused work periods.

134
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:02,178
Negotiate for some remote work days if possible, even in hybrid environments.

135
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:06,068
And take real breaks between meetings to recharge.

136
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:15,023
Learn to say, I need to think about this and get back to you, rather than feeling pressured to respond immediately.

137
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:23,035
If you're an extrovert, your biggest career liability might be perceived superficiality or lack of follow-through.

138
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:31,133
You're great at starting things and generating ideas, but may struggle with the sustained focus needed to execute.

139
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,899
The solution is to build systems for depth.

140
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,826
Partner with introverted colleagues who excel at implementation.

141
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:44,754
Use project management tools that help you track details.

142
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:48,780
Schedule regular reflection time to process what you're learning.

143
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:57,201
Force yourself to do deeper research before meetings rather than relying solely on thinking out loud.

144
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:03,755
Find an introverted mentor who can model deep expertise and sustained focus.

145
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:10,342
Another challenge for extroverts is managing your energy and roles, requiring extended focus.

146
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:17,491
If you're in a position requiring significant independent work, build in collaborative breaks.

147
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:22,819
Schedule working sessions with colleagues, even if you're working on different projects.

148
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:24,982
Take calls while walking.

149
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:31,633
Process your thoughts through voice memos or by teaching someone else what you're learning.

150
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:37,979
Join professional groups or committees that give you regular interaction outside your core work.

151
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:39,942
Here's the advanced insight.

152
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:44,813
Jung also taught that we each have access to both orientations.

153
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:51,866
But one is conscious and developed while the other remains more unconscious and primitive.

154
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,251
He called the less developed orientation the inferior function.

155
00:17:57,032 --> 00:18:05,342
Understanding this is crucial because your inferior function will emerge under stress, often in dysfunctional ways.

156
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:16,773
For introverts under stress, the inferior extroversion might emerge as uncharacteristic outbursts, desperate networking attempts.

157
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,714
or manic social activity that leads to exhaustion.

158
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:32,652
If you find yourself suddenly trying to connect with everyone, oversharing, or making impulsive commitments, you might be in the grip of your inferior function.

159
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:44,127
The solution is to return to your dominant, introverted approach first, process what's happening internally, then engage with others more intentionally.

160
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:57,786
For extroverts under stress, the inferior introversion might emerge as withdrawal, brooding, pessimistic rumination, or paralysis through over-analysis.

161
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:10,314
If you find yourself unusually isolated, unable to make decisions, or trapped in negative thought loops, You might be in the grip of your inferior function.

162
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:15,830
The solution is to return to your dominant, extroverted approach first.

163
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:19,583
Talk through what's happening with trusted others.

164
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:22,348
Take action, even if imperfect.

165
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:26,915
Then reflect more carefully once you've regained equilibrium.

166
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:32,604
The most successful people aren't those who've mastered both orientations equally.

167
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:43,680
They're those who've fully developed their dominant orientation while learning when and how to access their non-dominant orientation strategically.

168
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:52,161
An introverted leader learns to give energizing public presentations by preparing thoroughly and building in recovery time.

169
00:19:52,902 --> 00:20:02,155
An extroverted analyst learns to produce deep research by partnering with others during the process and scheduling reflection time.

170
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,060
Let me share a historical example.

171
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:08,183
Albert Einstein was clearly an introvert.

172
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:15,579
He did his best thinking in solitude, often taking long walks alone to work through problems.

173
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:25,142
He famously said that he rarely thought in words at all, but in images and feelings that he only later translated to language.

174
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:36,564
His greatest breakthroughs came from sustained solitary contemplation, but Einstein also recognized when he needed to access his extroverted side.

175
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:46,438
He gave lectures, engaged in vigorous debates with colleagues, and used conversation to test and refine his ideas.

176
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:55,550
He didn't try to become an extrovert, but he strategically deployed extroverted behaviors when they served his work.

177
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:56,775
and crucially.

178
00:20:57,576 --> 00:21:05,948
He structured his life and career to maximize his introverted strengths while minimizing situations that would drain him.

179
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:10,414
Conversely, Richard Branson is clearly an extrovert.

180
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:20,417
He's energized by people, builds businesses through relationships, and makes decisions through action and feedback.

181
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:26,776
He's dyslexic and by his own admission not naturally inclined toward deep.

182
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:30,246
Solitary analysis of written material.

183
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:45,441
But he's built a business empire by leveraging his extroverted strengths, surrounding himself with detail-oriented introverts who compliment his style, and creating organizational structures that play to his type.

184
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:51,346
Both are wildly successful, not despite their type, but because they fully leveraged it.

185
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:55,872
This is the career strategy that Young's typology suggests.

186
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,173
Know yourself deeply.

187
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:01,270
Structure your career around your strengths.

188
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:04,214
Develop strategies for your challenges.

189
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:11,686
And access your non-preferred orientation strategically rather than trying to become someone you're not.

190
00:22:12,428 --> 00:22:13,809
So here's your action plan.

191
00:22:14,571 --> 00:22:17,296
First, honestly assess your type.

192
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:24,988
Don't base this on whether you're shy or outgoing, but on where your energy naturally flows.

193
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:29,465
Do you need to process experiences internally before acting?

194
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:32,952
Or do you process through external engagement?

195
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:36,480
Do you find depth energizing or draining?

196
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:40,429
Do you prefer variety or sustained focus?

197
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:41,932
Be honest.

198
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,596
Not aspirational.

199
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:49,432
Second, audit your current role and work environment.

200
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:55,159
Does it align with your type's strengths or constantly force you into your weaker orientation?

201
00:22:55,818 --> 00:23:05,387
If you're an introvert in a role with constant meetings and interruptions, or an extrovert in an isolated position, you're fighting uphill.

202
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:11,133
Consider how you might reshape your current role or whether it's time to find a better fit.

203
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:15,837
Third, develop your type-specific career strategies.

204
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:27,090
Introverts should focus on building deep expertise, creating systems for visibility, and finding roles where thoughtfulness is valued.

205
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:39,525
Extroverts should focus on leveraging networks, partnering with detail-oriented colleagues, and finding roles where relationship-building drives success.

206
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,247
Fourth.

207
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:46,441
Learn to recognize when you're in the grip of your inferior function under stress.

208
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:54,259
Instead of pushing harder in the wrong direction, return to your dominant orientation to regain equilibrium.

209
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,248
Then engage your non-preferred side more skillfully.

210
00:23:58,989 --> 00:23:59,691
Fifth.

211
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:04,075
Find mentors and colleagues who complement your type.

212
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:10,281
Introverts benefit from extroverted advocates who can champion their work.

213
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:15,887
Extroverts benefit from introverted colleagues who can help with follow-through and depth.

214
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:22,134
The most successful teams aren't all one type, but leverage the strengths of both.

215
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:33,317
Carl Jung believed that the ultimate goal of psychological development was individuation, becoming fully yourself rather than conforming to collective expectations.

216
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:37,162
This applies profoundly to career development.

217
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:43,631
The path to professional success and satisfaction isn't becoming the person you think employers want.

218
00:24:44,512 --> 00:24:52,002
It's becoming more fully the person you actually are and finding or creating roles where that person can thrive.

219
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:55,550
Your career shouldn't be a daily battle against your nature.

220
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,439
It should be an expression of your nature.

221
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:09,486
When you stop trying to force yourself into an ill-fitting mold and instead leverage your Jungian type, work becomes energizing rather than draining.

222
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:17,276
You develop genuine competitive advantages because you're operating from your strengths rather than constantly managing weaknesses.

223
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:24,585
You find sustainable success because you're not burning energy pretending to be someone you're not.

224
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:31,173
The career advice industry often sells a one-size-fits-all vision of success.

225
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:32,675
Be bold.

226
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:34,718
Network constantly.

227
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:36,319
Promote yourself.

228
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:38,442
Think big.

229
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:40,227
move fast.

230
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:46,211
But for introverts, this formula is exhausting and often counterproductive.

231
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:55,579
The same industry sometimes tells extroverts to slow down, focus more, stop chasing shiny objects.

232
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,884
But for many extroverts, this advice fights their natural gifts.

233
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:04,708
Jung offers a different path.

234
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:06,490
Understand your type deeply.

235
00:26:07,162 --> 00:26:09,184
Leverage its inherent strengths.

236
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:11,867
Manage its predictable challenges.

237
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:17,615
And access your non-preferred orientation strategically when needed.

238
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:25,426
This is how you build not just a successful career, but a career that actually fits who you are.

239
00:26:26,248 --> 00:26:27,869
So here's your challenge.

240
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:38,300
This week, identify one way your current work situation is forcing you to operate constantly in your non-preferred orientation.

241
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:45,929
Then brainstorm one structural change that would allow you to leverage your natural type more effectively.

242
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:55,877
Maybe it's negotiating for more focused work time or more collaborative projects or a different communication style with your team.

243
00:26:56,578 --> 00:27:01,888
Whatever it is, Take one action toward aligning your work with your type.

244
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:07,395
The career you're meant to have isn't the one that requires you to become someone else.

245
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:11,721
It's the one that allows you to become more fully yourself.

246
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:13,623
Thank you for watching.

247
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:20,991
