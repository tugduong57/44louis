but

476
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:05,287
they'll

because

503
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:15,758
it

504
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:16,418

00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:39,166
means

1277
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:39,605
they

1278
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:39,765
can

1279
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:40,167
handle

1280
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:40,807
dynamic

1281
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,668
situations,

1282
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:42,870
pivot

1283
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:43,610
strategies

1284
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:43,910
in

1285
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,270
real

1286
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:44,731
time,

1287
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:45,533
and

1288
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,033
respond

1289
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:46,153
to

1290
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:46,714
feedback

1291
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:47,595
immediately.

1292
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:48,515
This

1293
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:48,655
is

1294
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:49,616
invaluable

1295
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:49,856
in

1296
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:50,658
fast-paced

1297
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:51,379
environments

1298
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:51,839
and

1299
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:52,340
crisis

1300
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,140
situations.

1301
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:54,461
However,

1302
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:55,903
extroverts

1303
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:56,283
face

1304
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:56,504
their

1305
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:56,804
own

1306
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:57,485
challenges.

1307
00:11:58,506 --> 00:11:58,647
They

1308
00:11:58,706 --> 00:11:58,826
may

1309
00:11:58,907 --> 00:11:59,287
struggle

1310
00:11:59,327 --> 00:11:59,467
with

1311
00:11:59,548 --> 00:11:59,847
roles

1312
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,509
requiring

1313
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:01,068
extended

1314
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:01,549
periods

1315
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,629
of

1316
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,431
solitary,

1317
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:03,692
focused

1318
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:04,393
work,

1319
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,181
they

1320
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,422
might

1321
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:05,682
find

1322
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:05,782
it

1323
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:06,263
difficult

1324
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:06,403
to

1325
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:06,842
develop

1326
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:07,163
deep

1327
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:07,965
expertise

1328
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:08,525
because

1329
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:08,785
they're

1330
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:09,187
drawn

1331
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:09,346
to

1332
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:10,067
variety

1333
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:10,508
and

1334
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:10,708
new

1335
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:11,629
experiences.

1336
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:12,851
They

1337
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:13,032
can

1338
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:13,211
make

1339
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:13,712
hasty

1340
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:14,374
decisions

1341
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:14,894
because

1342
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:15,134
their

1343
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:15,634
bias

1344
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:16,035
is

1345
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:16,355
toward

1346
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:16,956
action

1347
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:17,538
rather

1348
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:17,717
than

1349
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:18,438
reflection.

1350
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:19,299
They

1351
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,539
might

1352
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:19,980
also

1353
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:20,642
experience

1354
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:21,163
burnout

1355
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:21,342
in

1356
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:21,984
environments

1357
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:22,163
that

1358
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:22,303
are

1359
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:22,543
too

1360
00:12:22,764 --> 00:12:23,346
isolated

1361
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:23,785
or

1362
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:24,005
where

1363
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:24,187
they

1364
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:24,486
lack

1365
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:25,347
opportunities

1366
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:25,528
for

1367
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:26,429
collaboration

1368
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:26,830
and

1369
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,750
interaction.

1370
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:28,753
Here's

1371
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:28,952
where

1372
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:29,394
Jung's

1373
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:30,034
insight

1374
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:30,715
becomes

1375
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:31,235
career

1376
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:31,917
changing.

1377
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:32,667
The

1378
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:33,048
goal

1379
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:33,388
isn't

1380
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:33,528
to

1381
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:34,149
overcome

1382
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:34,349
your

1383
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:34,729
type,

1384
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:35,089
but

1385
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:35,250
to

1386
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,809
leverage

1387
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:35,909
it.

1388
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:36,890
This

1389
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:37,191
means

1390
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:37,532
three

1391
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:37,951
things.

1392
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:39,354
First,

1393
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:40,615
choosing

1394
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:41,215
roles

1395
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:41,375
and

1396
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:42,096
environments

1397
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:42,296
that

1398
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:42,817
align

1399
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:42,976
with

1400
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:43,157
your

1401
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:43,496
type's

1402
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:44,077
strengths.

1403
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:45,339
Second,

1404
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,659
developing

1405
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,380
strategies

1406
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:47,520
to

1407
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,022
manage

1408
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:48,201
your

1409
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:48,562
type's

1410
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:49,283
challenges.

1411
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:50,683
Third,

1412
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:52,265
understanding

1413
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:52,426
that

1414
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:52,586
you

1415
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:52,765
can

1416
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:53,407
access

1417
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:53,647
your

1418
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:54,548
non-preferred

1419
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:55,448
orientation

1420
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:55,649
when

1421
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,048
needed,

1422
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:56,850
but

1423
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:56,950
it

1424
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:57,149
will

1425
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:57,490
cost

1426
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:57,770
more

1427
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,831
energy.

1428
00:12:59,048 --> 00:12:59,268
Let's

1429
00:12:59,307 --> 00:12:59,548
start

1430
00:12:59,589 --> 00:12:59,688
with

1431
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:00,009
role

1432
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:00,590
selection.

1433
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:01,392
If

1434
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:01,631
you're

1435
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:01,711
an

1436
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,174
introvert,

1437
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:03,394
look

1438
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:03,575
for

1439
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:04,196
positions

1440
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:04,376
that

1441
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:04,736
allow

1442
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:04,957
for

1443
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:05,278
deep

1444
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:06,320
work,

1445
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,900
independent

1446
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:07,542
projects,

1447
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:08,683
and

1448
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:09,345
meaningful

1449
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:10,547
one-on-one

1450
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:11,508
interactions.

1451
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,529
This

1452
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:12,850
doesn't

1453
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:13,051
mean

1454
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:13,510
avoiding

1455
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:13,792
all

1456
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:14,413
teamwork

1457
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:14,533
or

1458
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:14,913
client

1459
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:16,255
contact,

1460
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:16,375
but

1461
00:13:16,436 --> 00:13:16,897
ensuring

1462
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:17,136
these

1463
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:17,418
aren't

1464
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:18,078
constant.

1465
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:19,240
Look

1466
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:19,441
for

1467
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,402
organizations

1468
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:20,582
that

1469
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:21,183
value

1470
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:21,484
written

1471
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:22,346
communication.

1472
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:23,407
Give

1473
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:23,868
time

1474
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:24,048
for

1475
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:24,528
thoughtful

1476
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:25,730
responses.

1477
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:26,350
and

1478
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:26,671
don't

1479
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,150
mistake

1480
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:27,652
quiet

1481
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:27,812
for

1482
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:28,774
disengagement.

1483
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:30,015

2125
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,830
first.

2126
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:17,035
Talk

2127
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:17,477
through

2128
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:17,777
what's

2129
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:18,298

00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:20,346
Take

2134
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:20,787
action,

2135
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:21,488
even

2136
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:21,627

2138
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:23,270
Then

2139
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:23,730
reflect

2140
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:23,971
more

2141
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:24,613
carefully

2142
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:25,173
once

2143
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:25,433
you've

2144
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:26,015
regained

2145
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:26,915
equilibrium.

2146
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:27,797

They're

So

First,

2484
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:25,678
Do

2493
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:30,468
Or

2494
00:22:30,508 --> 00:22:30,567

Do

variety

2511
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:39,266

2514
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:41,471
Be

2515
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,932
honest.

2516
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:43,034
Not

2517
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:44,596
aspirational.

2518
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:45,189
Second,

2942
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:28,751

00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:39,442
Then

2961
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:40,343
