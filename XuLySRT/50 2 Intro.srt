1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:05,572
Hello and welcome back to Synchro.
Think about the last job interview you had.

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:14,214
You probably tried to present yourself as outgoing, energetic,
a team player who thrives in collaborative environments.

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,284
Even if you're someone who does their best thinking alone.

4
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,820
Even if small talk drains you.

5
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:24,824
Even if you'd rather spend your lunch break reading the networking.

6
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:32,198
We've been taught that success,
especially in our careers, belongs to the extroverts.

7
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:38,805
But what if everything you've been told about introversion
and extroversion is not just wrong,

8
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,275
but actively harming your career potential?

9
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:48,281
Carl Jong, the Swiss psychiatrist who first coined these terms,

10
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:54,421
had a radically different
understanding of what introversion and extroversion actually mean.

11
00:00:54,754 --> 00:01:00,760
And more importantly,
he understood how each type, when properly leveraged,

12
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:07,100
possesses
unique strengths that can lead to extraordinary professional success.

13
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:13,773
Today, we're going deep into Jungian typology to understand
not just what your type is,

14
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:20,947
but how to use it strategically to build a career that doesn't drain
you but energizes you.

15
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:30,190
By the end of this video, you'll understand why forcing yourself to be
someone you're not is the worst career strategy possible,

16
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:39,265
and how aligning your work with your psychological type can unlock
levels of success and satisfaction you didn't know were possible.

17
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,234
Let's dive in.

18
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:50,510
Before we can leverage your Jungian type, we need to understand
what Junge actually meant by introversion and extroversion.

19
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,279
Because it's probably not what you think.

20
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:59,452
In popular culture,
these terms have been reduced to simple social preferences.

21
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,123
Extroverts are outgoing and talkative.

22
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,925
Introverts are shy and quiet.

23
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:13,199
But Jong's original concept was far more sophisticated
and far more useful for career development.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,641
For Jong introversion and extroversion weren't about social skills
or preference for parties versus solitude.

25
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,679
They were about the fundamental orientation of your psychic energy.

26
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:32,519
They described where you naturally direct your attention
and from where you draw your vitality.

27
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:38,558
Jun wrote that the introverts interest flows inward toward the subject,
toward their own

28
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:46,132
internal psychological processes, ideas, impressions and reactions.

29
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:54,340
The introvert is oriented
primarily toward the inner world of thoughts, feelings and reflections.

30
00:02:55,208 --> 00:03:00,513
Their energy moves from the outer world inward, where it gets processed,

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,419
contemplated and given meaning before any outward action occurs.

32
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:14,561
The extrovert, by contrast, has their interest flowing outward
toward the object, toward people.

33
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,531
Things and external events.

34
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:26,773
The extrovert is oriented primarily
toward the outer world of action, interaction and tangible reality.

35
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:36,549
Their energy moves from inner experience, outward finding expression
and vitality through engagement with external environment.

36
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,452
Notice what Jong isn't saying.

37
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:45,625
He's not saying
introverts hate people or that extroverts can't think deeply.

38
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:50,396
He's describing the natural flow of psychic energy and attention.

39
00:03:50,563 --> 00:04:00,540
An introvert can be socially skilled, charismatic, even, but
they'll need time alone afterward to process the experience internally.

40
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,611
An extrovert can engage in deep reflection,

41
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:11,517
but they'll often need to talk through their thoughts with others
or take action to fully understand what they're thinking.

42
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:18,358
This distinction is crucial for your career because it determines
what kinds of work environments,

43
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:24,330
tasks and roles will energize you versus drain you.

44
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,899
Let's make this concrete with an example.

45
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:31,738
Consider two marketing professionals, David and Jennifer.

46
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,840
David is an introvert.

47
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:43,883
He does his best creative work when he can research, deeply develop
comprehensive strategies and refine his ideas before presenting them.

48
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,323
He's excellent in one on one client meetings where depth of relationship
matters.

49
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:58,298
He's the person who sends the follow up email that perfectly captures
what was discussed and moves the project forward.

50
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:04,737
His presentations are thoroughly prepared, insightful and impactful.

51
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,273
Jennifer is an extrovert.

52
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,181
She generates her best ideas in brainstorming sessions,
bouncing concepts off colleagues in real time.

53
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:22,288
She's energized by client calls,
networking events and collaborative workshops.

54
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:31,497
She thinks out loud, tests ideas through conversation and adapts quickly
based on immediate feedback.

55
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:38,838
Her presentations are dynamic, responsive to the room,
and create immediate engagement.

56
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:46,713
Both are excellent at marketing, but they're leveraging
completely different cognitive and energetic processes.

57
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:55,388
The tragedy is that many organizations only recognize
and reward Jennifer's style, leaving talented introverts

58
00:05:55,555 --> 00:06:02,495
like David feeling inadequate or trying to force themselves
into an extroverted mold that depletes them.

59
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:06,265
Here's the key insight that Young emphasized.

60
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,468
Neither type is superior.

61
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:13,573
Each has profound strengths and endeavor knowable limitations.

62
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,276
The question isn't which type is better for your career,

63
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:23,716
but how to structure your career around your types
Natural strengths while managing its weaknesses.

64
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:30,523
Let's explore the specific career advantages of each type,
starting with introversion.

65
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,194
Young observed that introverts excel at depth over breadth

66
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,598
because their energy flows inward.

67
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:47,073
They're naturally inclined toward sustained focus as complex problem
solving and developing expertise.

68
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:53,880
They're often the people who become true masters of their craft
because they're willing to spend hours,

69
00:06:54,414 --> 00:07:01,187
days, years
going deep into their subject matter in practical career terms.

70
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:11,230
This means introverts often excel in roles requiring specialized
knowledge, strategic thinking and independent work.

71
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,833
Research Scientists.

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,938
Software Developers. Writers. Analysts.

73
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:27,547
Financial planners, architects and academic researchers are fields
where introverted strengths shine.

74
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,284
But it's not limited to solitary professions.

75
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:38,057
Many successful executives, lawyers and consultants are introverts

76
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:44,230
who've learned to leverage their natural inclination
toward careful analysis and thoughtful decision making.

77
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:51,270
Introverts also tend to be excellent listeners,
which is an underrated career superpower.

78
00:07:52,138 --> 00:08:00,513
While an extrovert might be formulating their response, while
you're talking, the introvert is genuinely taking in what you're saying.

79
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:05,451
Processing it and forming a considered response.

80
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,855
This makes them exceptional. Counselors.

81
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,793
Coaches interview doers and advisors.

82
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,500
People feel heard and understood,
which builds deep professional relationships and trust.

83
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:27,406
Another advantage is that introverts are less dependent
on external validation for their motivation.

84
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:34,146
They're driven more by internal standards of excellence
and personal satisfaction with their work.

85
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:42,255
This can lead to more sustainable career satisfaction because
they're not constantly seeking approval or recognition from others.

86
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,895
They can weather periods
where their contributions aren't immediately visible or celebrated.

87
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:53,933
However, introverts face predictable career challenges.

88
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,504
They may struggle with self-promotion, networking events

89
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:04,277
and making their accomplishments visible in organizations
that reward vocal participation.

90
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:12,885
They might be overlooked for leadership roles because they don't fit
the stereotypical image of the charismatic, outgoing leader.

91
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:23,462
They can experience burnout in environments with constant meetings,
open plan offices, or an expectation of immediate responsiveness.

92
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,533
Now let's look at extroverted strengths.

93
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:34,807
Jung noted that extroverts excel at breadth over depth
because their energy flows outward.

94
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,610
They're naturally inclined toward building.

95
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,583
Networks generate doing ideas through interaction and taking action.

96
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:52,258
They're energized by variety stimulation and engagement
with people and projects in career terms.

97
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:58,831
Extroverts often thrive in roles
requiring relationship building, communication

98
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:06,172
and dynamic problem
solving sales, business development, public relations,

99
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:16,549
teaching, event management, hospitality and entrepreneurship are fields
where extroverted strengths shine.

100
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,785
But again, it's not limited.

101
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:26,325
Many successful researchers, engineers and analysts are extroverts

102
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:33,265
who leverage their ability to collaborate, share ideas
and build teams around their work.

103
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:39,772
Extroverts are typically skilled at networking,
not in a superficial way,

104
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:45,911
but because they're genuinely energized by meeting new people
and exploring connections.

105
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,584
This creates career opportunities that might never appear on job boards.

106
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,453
They hear about positions through their network.

107
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:01,894
Get introductions to key decision makers and build relationships
that open doors throughout their career.

108
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:08,401
Another advantage is that extroverts
tend to be comfortable with visibility and self-promotion.

109
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:16,175
They can articulate their ideas and accomplishments
without feeling like they're bragging in organizational settings.

110
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,845
This means their work gets noticed.

111
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:26,585
They're top of mind for new opportunities,
and they're often perceived as leadership material.

112
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:33,292
Extroverts also excel at thinking on their feet
and adapting to changing circumstances.

113
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:41,734
They process information through external engagement,
which means they can handle dynamic situations,

114
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:48,040
pivot strategies in real time, and respond to feedback immediately.

115
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:53,746
This is invaluable in fast paced environments and crisis situations.

116
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:58,217
However, extroverts face their own challenges.

117
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:04,390
They may struggle with roles
requiring extended periods of solitary focused work.

118
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:11,731
They might find it difficult to develop deep expertise
because they're drawn to variety and new experiences.

119
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,969
They can make hasty decisions because their bias is toward action.

120
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,871
Rather than reflection,

121
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:27,546
they might also experience burnout in environments that are too isolated
or where they lack opportunities for collaboration and interaction.

122
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,251
Here's where Jong's insight becomes career changing.

123
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,422
The goal isn't to overcome your type, but to leverage it.

124
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:44,163
This means three things First, choosing roles and environments
that align with your type strengths.

125
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,935
Second, developing strategies to manage your types challenges.

126
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:58,377
Third, understanding that you can access your non-preferred orientation
when needed, but it will cost more energy.

127
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,013
Let's start with role selection.

128
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:11,557
If you're an introvert, look for positions that allow for deep work
independent projects and meaningful one on one interactions.

129
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:18,230
This doesn't mean avoiding all teamwork or client contact,
but ensuring these aren't constant.

130
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,868
Look for organizations that value written communication.

131
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:29,041
Give time for thoughtful responses
and don't mistake quiet for disengagement.

132
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:34,880
Consider roles like research analyst, Technical specialist,

133
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:40,920
Strategic planner, content creator, or backend developer.

134
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:48,060
Even in traditionally extroverted fields,
look for the introverted niches in sales.

135
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:54,700
Consider technical sales
where product expertise matters more than schmoozing in management.

136
00:13:55,367 --> 00:14:01,073
Consider project management or operations roles
rather than business development.

137
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,744
If you're an extrovert, look for positions with variety.

138
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:10,749
Interact and opportunities to think through conversation.

139
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,119
Seek organizations with collaborative cultures.

140
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:18,958
Open communication and value for relationship building.

141
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:25,097
Consider roles like Account Manager, Business development, Team Leader.

142
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:29,501
Trainer, recruiter or consultant.

143
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:37,176
Even in traditionally introverted fields,
find the extroverted angles in software development.

144
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:43,682
Consider product management or developer relations in research.

145
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:52,758
Consider roles involving collaboration, presentation,
or translation of technical findings for broader audiences.

146
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,795
Now let's talk about managing your challenges.

147
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:02,968
If you're an introvert, your biggest career
liability is often invisibility.

148
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:06,605
You might do excellent work that no one knows about.

149
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:12,778
The solution isn't to become an extrovert,
but to create systems for visibility.

150
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:19,184
Schedule regular one on one updates with your manager
where you can discuss your work in depth.

151
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:24,990
Document your contributions in writing
where you're more comfortable articulating your value.

152
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:30,496
Choose one or two networking events per quarter
rather than trying to attend everything.

153
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:36,435
Prepare specific talking points about your projects
so you're not caught off guard.

154
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:42,007
Find an extroverted mentor or colleague
who can help advocate for your work.

155
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:48,480
Another challenge for introverts
is the energy drain of excessive meetings and collaboration.

156
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,117
Build boundaries around your deep work time.

157
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,988
BLOCK off your calendar for focused work periods.

158
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:02,161
Negotiate for some remote work days
if possible, even in hybrid environments.

159
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,632
Take real breaks between meetings to recharge.

160
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:15,040
Learn to say I need to think about this and get back to you
rather than feeling pressured to respond and immediately.

161
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:23,048
If you're an extrovert, your biggest career
liability might be perceived superficiality or lack of follow through.

162
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:29,321
Your great at starting things and generating ideas,
but may struggle with the sustained

163
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:35,327
focus needed to execute The solution is to build systems for depth.

164
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:40,332
Partner with introverted colleagues who excel at implementation.

165
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,870
Use project management tools that help you track details.

166
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,174
Schedule regular reflection time to process what you're learning.

167
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:57,216
Force yourself to do deeper research before meetings
rather than relying solely on thinking out loud.

168
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,722
Find an introverted mentor
who can model deep expertise and sustained focus.

169
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:10,462
Another challenge for extroverts
is managing your energy in roles requiring extended focus.

170
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:17,603
If you're in a position
requiring significant independent work, build in collaborative breaks.

171
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,342
Schedule working sessions with colleagues,
even if you're working on different projects.

172
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,377
Take calls while walking.

173
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:31,550
Process your thoughts through voice memos, or by teaching someone else
what you're learning.

174
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:38,023
Join professional groups or committees
that give you regular interaction outside your core work.

175
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,426
Here's the advanced insight.

176
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:45,464
You also taught that we each have access to both orientations,

177
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:51,637
but one is conscious and developed
while the other remains more unconscious and primitive.

178
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,675
He called the less developed orientation the inferior function.

179
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:05,451
Understanding this is crucial because your inferior function
will emerge under stress, often in dysfunctional ways.

180
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:13,892
For introverts under stress, the inferior extroversion
might emerge as uncharacterized stick outbursts,

181
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:20,766
desperate networking attempts, or manic social activity
that leads to exhaustion.

182
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:26,905
If you find yourself suddenly trying to connect with everyone
oversharing

183
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:33,045
or making impulsive commitments,
you might be in the grip of your inferior function.

184
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:40,752
The solution is to return to your dominant, introverted approach
first process what's happening internally,

185
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,623
then engage with others more intentionally.

186
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:51,797
For extroverts under stress,
the inferior introversion might emerge as withdrawal, brooding,

187
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:58,403
pessimistic rumination or paralysis through over analysis.

188
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,576
If you find yourself unusually isolated, unable to make decisions

189
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:10,716
or trapped in negative
thought loops, you might be in the grip of your inferior function.

190
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:15,120
The solution is to return to your dominant, extroverted approach.

191
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:19,825
First, talk through what's happening with trusted others.

192
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:24,663
Take action. Even if imperfect, then reflect more carefully.

193
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:32,638
Once you've regained equilibrium, the most successful people aren't
those who've mastered both orientation as equally.

194
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:41,780
There are those who fully develop their dominant orientation
while learning when and how to access their non-dominant orientation.

195
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:48,453
And strategically,
an introverted leader learns to give energizing public presentations

196
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:52,558
by preparing thoroughly and building in recovery time.

197
00:19:52,724 --> 00:20:02,167
And extroverted analyst learns to produce deep research by partnering
with others during the process and scheduling reflection time.

198
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,404
Let me share a historical example.

199
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,640
Albert Einstein was clearly an introvert.

200
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:15,647
He did his best thinking in solitude, often
taking long walks alone to work through problems.

201
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,551
He famously said that he rarely thought in words at all.

202
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:25,424
But in images and feelings that he only later translated to language.

203
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:31,263
His greatest breakthroughs came from sustained, solitary contemplation.

204
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,969
But Einstein also recognized
when he needed to access his extroverted side.

205
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:46,511
He gave lectures, engaged in vigorous debates with colleagues,
and used conversation to test and refine his ideas.

206
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:55,120
He didn't try to become an extrovert, but he strategically deployed
extroverted behaviors when they served his work.

207
00:20:55,654 --> 00:21:05,964
And crucially, he structured his life and career to maximize his
introverted strengths while minimizing situations that would drain him.

208
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:10,969
Conversely, Richard Branson is clearly an extrovert.

209
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:20,479
He's energized by people, builds businesses through relationships,
and makes decisions through action and feedback.

210
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:29,821
He's dyslexic and, by his own admission, not naturally inclined toward
deep, solitary analysis of written material.

211
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:38,664
But he's built a business empire by leveraging his extroverted
strengths, surrounding himself with detail oriented introverts

212
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:44,870
who complement his style
and creating organizational structures that play to his type.

213
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:51,310
Both are wildly successful, not despite their type,
but because they fully leveraged it.

214
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,415
This is the career strategy that Jung's typology suggests.

215
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,750
Know yourself deeply.

216
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,920
Structure your career around your strengths.

217
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,990
Develop strategies for your challenges

218
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:11,730
and access your non-preferred orientation
strategically, rather than trying to become someone you're not.

219
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,232
So here's your action plan.

220
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,536
First, honestly, assess your type.

221
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:24,609
Don't base this on whether you're shy or outgoing,
but on where your energy naturally flows.

222
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:32,918
Do you need to process experiences internally before acting,
or do you process through external engagement?

223
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,922
Do you find depth energizing or draining?

224
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,992
Do you prefer variety or sustained focus?

225
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,529
Be honest, not aspirational.

226
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:49,167
Second, audit your current role and work environment.

227
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:55,340
Does it align with your type strengths
or constantly force you into your weaker orientation?

228
00:22:55,674 --> 00:23:03,682
If you're an introvert in a role with constant meetings
and interruptions and or an extrovert in an isolated position,

229
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,884
you're fighting uphill.

230
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:11,490
Consider how you might reshape your current role,
or whether it's time to find a better fit.

231
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:16,428
Third, develop your type specific career strategies.

232
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:23,034
Introverts should focus on building
deep expertise, ease creating systems for visibility,

233
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:27,472
and finding roles where thoughtfulness is valued.

234
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:33,345
Extroverts should focus on leveraging networks, partnering with detail

235
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:39,584
oriented colleagues,
and finding roles where relationship building drives success.

236
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:46,558
Fourth, learn to recognize
when you're in the grip of your inferior function under stress.

237
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:52,564
Instead of pushing harder in the wrong direction,
return to your dominant orientation

238
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:58,570
to regain equilibrium, then engage
your non-preferred side more skillfully.

239
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:04,509
Fifth, find mentors and colleagues who complement your type.

240
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:09,915
Introverts benefit from extroverted advocates
who can champion their work.

241
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:16,054
Extroverts benefit from introverted colleagues
who can help with follow through and depth.

242
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:22,160
The most successful teams aren't all one type,
but leverage the strengths of both.

243
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:28,333
Carl Jung believed that the ultimate goal
of psychological development was individuation

244
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,972
becoming fully yourself
rather than conforming to collective expectations.

245
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,576
This applies profoundly to career development.

246
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:43,748
The path to professional success
and satisfaction isn't becoming the person you think employers want.

247
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:51,490
It's becoming more fully the person you actually are
and finding or creating roles where that person can thrive.

248
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,994
Your career shouldn't be a daily battle against your nature.

249
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:02,701
It should be an expression of your nature
when you stop trying to force yourself into an ill fitting mold

250
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:08,940
and instead leverage your union type work becomes energizing
rather than draining.

251
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:17,382
You develop genuine competitive advantages because you're operating
from your strengths rather than constantly managing weaknesses.

252
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:24,623
You find sustainable success
because you're not burning energy pretending to be someone you're not.

253
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:31,263
The career advice industry often sells a one size fits
all vision of success.

254
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:36,935
Be bold. Network. Constantly promote yourself.

255
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,971
Think big. Move fast.

256
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:46,244
But for introverts,
this formula is exhausting and often counterproductive.

257
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:51,616
The same industry sometimes tells extroverts to slow down.

258
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,451
Focus more.

259
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,254
Stop chasing shiny objects.

260
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:01,459
But for many extroverts, this advice fights their natural gifts.

261
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,362
Jung offers a different path.

262
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:11,970
Understand your type deeply leverage
its inherent strengths to manage its predictable challenges

263
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:18,009
and access your non-preferred orientation strategically when needed.

264
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:25,450
This is how you build not just a successful career,
but a career that actually fits who you are.

265
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,254
So here's your challenge this week.

266
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:38,330
Identify one way your current work situation is forcing you
to operate constantly in your non-preferred orientation.

267
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:45,904
Then brainstorm one structural change
that would allow you to leverage your natural type more effectively.

268
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:55,847
Maybe it's negotiating for more focused work time or more collaborative
projects, or a different communication style with your team.

269
00:26:56,414 --> 00:27:02,354
Whatever it is, take one action
toward aligning your work with your type.

270
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,193
The career you're meant to have isn't the one that requires you
to become someone else.

271
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,364
It's the one that allows you to become more fully yourself.

272
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,700
Thank you for watching. Let me know in the comments.

273
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,339
Whether you're an introvert or extrovert
and what career strategies have worked for you.

274
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,609
And as always, I'll see you in the next video.
