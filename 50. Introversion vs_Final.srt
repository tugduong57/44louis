00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:05,572 5.506
Hello and welcome back to Synchro. Think about the last job interview you had.

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:14,214 8.475
You probably tried to present yourself as outgoing, energetic, a team player who thrives in collaborative environments.

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:24,824 9.976
Even if you're someone who does their best thinking alone. Even if small talk drains you. Even if you'd rather spend your lunch break reading the networking.

4
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:32,198 7.207
We've been taught that success, especially in our careers, belongs to the extroverts.

5
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:42,275 9.276
But what if everything you've been told about introversion and extroversion is not just wrong, but actively harming your career potential?

6
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:54,421 11.979
Carl Jong, the Swiss psychiatrist who first coined these terms, had a radically different understanding of what introversion and extroversion actually mean.

7
00:00:54,754 --> 00:01:07,100 12.346
And more importantly, he understood how each type, when properly leveraged, possesses unique strengths that can lead to extraordinary professional success.

8
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:20,947 13.68
Today, we're going deep into Jungian typology to understand not just what your type is, but how to use it strategically to build a career that doesn't drain you but energizes you.

9
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:39,265 17.751
By the end of this video, you'll understand why forcing yourself to be someone you're not is the worst career strategy possible, and how aligning your work with your psychological type can unlock levels of success and satisfaction you didn't know were possible.

10
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:50,510 10.677
Let's dive in. Before we can leverage your Jungian type, we need to understand what Junge actually meant by introversion and extroversion.

11
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:59,452 8.408
Because it's probably not what you think. In popular culture, these terms have been reduced to simple social preferences.

12
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:05,925 5.839
Extroverts are outgoing and talkative. Introverts are shy and quiet.

13
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:13,199 7.107
But Jong's original concept was far more sophisticated and far more useful for career development.

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,641 7.841
For Jong introversion and extroversion weren't about social skills or preference for parties versus solitude.

15
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:32,519 10.177
They were about the fundamental orientation of your psychic energy. They described where you naturally direct your attention and from where you draw your vitality.

16
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:46,132 13.447
Jun wrote that the introverts interest flows inward toward the subject, toward their own internal psychological processes, ideas, impressions and reactions.

17
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:54,340 7.574
The introvert is oriented primarily toward the inner world of thoughts, feelings and reflections.

18
00:02:55,208 --> 00:03:06,419 11.211
Their energy moves from the outer world inward, where it gets processed, contemplated and given meaning before any outward action occurs.

19
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:14,561 7.975
The extrovert, by contrast, has their interest flowing outward toward the object, toward people.

20
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,531 3.403
Things and external events.

21
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:26,773 8.075
The extrovert is oriented primarily toward the outer world of action, interaction and tangible reality.

22
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:36,549 8.942
Their energy moves from inner experience, outward finding expression and vitality through engagement with external environment.

23
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:45,625 8.542
Notice what Jong isn't saying. He's not saying introverts hate people or that extroverts can't think deeply.

24
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:50,396 4.538
He's describing the natural flow of psychic energy and attention.

25
00:03:50,563 --> 00:04:00,540 9.977
An introvert can be socially skilled, charismatic, even, but they'll need time alone afterward to process the experience internally.

26
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:11,517 10.443
An extrovert can engage in deep reflection, but they'll often need to talk through their thoughts with others or take action to fully understand what they're thinking.

27
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:24,330 12.279
This distinction is crucial for your career because it determines what kinds of work environments, tasks and roles will energize you versus drain you.

28
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:33,840 9.343
Let's make this concrete with an example. Consider two marketing professionals, David and Jennifer. David is an introvert.

29
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:43,883 9.876
He does his best creative work when he can research, deeply develop comprehensive strategies and refine his ideas before presenting them.

30
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,323 5.773
He's excellent in one on one client meetings where depth of relationship matters.

31
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:58,298 7.808
He's the person who sends the follow up email that perfectly captures what was discussed and moves the project forward.

32
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:07,273 8.241
His presentations are thoroughly prepared, insightful and impactful. Jennifer is an extrovert.

33
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,181 7.741
She generates her best ideas in brainstorming sessions, bouncing concepts off colleagues in real time.

34
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:22,288 6.473
She's energized by client calls, networking events and collaborative workshops.

35
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:31,497 8.542
She thinks out loud, tests ideas through conversation and adapts quickly based on immediate feedback.

36
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:38,838 6.707
Her presentations are dynamic, responsive to the room, and create immediate engagement.

37
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:46,713 7.374
Both are excellent at marketing, but they're leveraging completely different cognitive and energetic processes.

38
00:05:47,380 --> 00:06:02,495 15.115
The tragedy is that many organizations only recognize and reward Jennifer's style, leaving talented introverts like David feeling inadequate or trying to force themselves into an extroverted mold that depletes them.

39
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:13,573 10.511
Here's the key insight that Young emphasized. Neither type is superior. Each has profound strengths and endeavor knowable limitations.

40
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:23,716 9.976
The question isn't which type is better for your career, but how to structure your career around your types Natural strengths while managing its weaknesses.

41
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:30,523 6.073
Let's explore the specific career advantages of each type, starting with introversion.

42
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:38,598 7.508
Young observed that introverts excel at depth over breadth because their energy flows inward.

43
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:47,073 8.308
They're naturally inclined toward sustained focus as complex problem solving and developing expertise.

44
00:06:47,874 --> 00:07:01,187 13.313
They're often the people who become true masters of their craft because they're willing to spend hours, days, years going deep into their subject matter in practical career terms.

45
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:11,230 9.342
This means introverts often excel in roles requiring specialized knowledge, strategic thinking and independent work.

46
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:18,938 7.074
Research Scientists. Software Developers. Writers. Analysts.

47
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:27,547 8.442
Financial planners, architects and academic researchers are fields where introverted strengths shine.

48
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,284 2.97
But it's not limited to solitary professions.

49
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:44,230 12.779
Many successful executives, lawyers and consultants are introverts who've learned to leverage their natural inclination toward careful analysis and thoughtful decision making.

50
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:51,270 6.54
Introverts also tend to be excellent listeners, which is an underrated career superpower.

51
00:07:52,138 --> 00:08:00,513 8.375
While an extrovert might be formulating their response, while you're talking, the introvert is genuinely taking in what you're saying.

52
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:08,855 7.808
Processing it and forming a considered response. This makes them exceptional. Counselors.

53
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,793 4.772
Coaches interview doers and advisors.

54
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,500 6.54
People feel heard and understood, which builds deep professional relationships and trust.

55
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:27,406 6.273
Another advantage is that introverts are less dependent on external validation for their motivation.

56
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:34,146 6.039
They're driven more by internal standards of excellence and personal satisfaction with their work.

57
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:42,255 7.575
This can lead to more sustainable career satisfaction because they're not constantly seeking approval or recognition from others.

58
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:53,933 10.844
They can weather periods where their contributions aren't immediately visible or celebrated. However, introverts face predictable career challenges.

59
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:04,277 10.177
They may struggle with self-promotion, networking events and making their accomplishments visible in organizations that reward vocal participation.

60
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:12,885 8.442
They might be overlooked for leadership roles because they don't fit the stereotypical image of the charismatic, outgoing leader.

61
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:23,462 9.776
They can experience burnout in environments with constant meetings, open plan offices, or an expectation of immediate responsiveness.

62
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:34,807 10.711
Now let's look at extroverted strengths. Jung noted that extroverts excel at breadth over depth because their energy flows outward.

63
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:43,583 7.975
They're naturally inclined toward building. Networks generate doing ideas through interaction and taking action.

64
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:52,258 8.509
They're energized by variety stimulation and engagement with people and projects in career terms.

65
00:09:52,858 --> 00:10:16,549 23.691
Extroverts often thrive in roles requiring relationship building, communication and dynamic problem solving sales, business development, public relations, teaching, event management, hospitality and entrepreneurship are fields where extroverted strengths shine.

66
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,785 2.736
But again, it's not limited.

67
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:33,265 13.313
Many successful researchers, engineers and analysts are extroverts who leverage their ability to collaborate, share ideas and build teams around their work.

68
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:45,911 12.145
Extroverts are typically skilled at networking, not in a superficial way, but because they're genuinely energized by meeting new people and exploring connections.

69
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:54,453 8.375
This creates career opportunities that might never appear on job boards. They hear about positions through their network.

70
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:01,894 7.274
Get introductions to key decision makers and build relationships that open doors throughout their career.

71
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:08,401 5.973
Another advantage is that extroverts tend to be comfortable with visibility and self-promotion.

72
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:19,845 10.744
They can articulate their ideas and accomplishments without feeling like they're bragging in organizational settings. This means their work gets noticed.

73
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:26,585 6.573
They're top of mind for new opportunities, and they're often perceived as leadership material.

74
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:33,292 6.106
Extroverts also excel at thinking on their feet and adapting to changing circumstances.

75
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:48,040 13.914
They process information through external engagement, which means they can handle dynamic situations, pivot strategies in real time, and respond to feedback immediately.

76
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:58,217 10.01
This is invaluable in fast paced environments and crisis situations. However, extroverts face their own challenges.

77
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:04,390 6.006
They may struggle with roles requiring extended periods of solitary focused work.

78
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:11,731 6.807
They might find it difficult to develop deep expertise because they're drawn to variety and new experiences.

79
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,969 4.371
They can make hasty decisions because their bias is toward action.

80
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:27,546 10.443
Rather than reflection, they might also experience burnout in environments that are too isolated or where they lack opportunities for collaboration and interaction.

81
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:36,422 8.042
Here's where Jong's insight becomes career changing. The goal isn't to overcome your type, but to leverage it.

82
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:44,163 7.574
This means three things First, choosing roles and environments that align with your type strengths.

83
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,935 5.105
Second, developing strategies to manage your types challenges.

84
00:12:50,102 --> 00:13:01,013 10.911
Third, understanding that you can access your non-preferred orientation when needed, but it will cost more energy. Let's start with role selection.

85
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:11,557 10.377
If you're an introvert, look for positions that allow for deep work independent projects and meaningful one on one interactions.

86
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:22,868 10.644
This doesn't mean avoiding all teamwork or client contact, but ensuring these aren't constant. Look for organizations that value written communication.

87
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:29,041 6.006
Give time for thoughtful responses and don't mistake quiet for disengagement.

88
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:40,920 11.412
Consider roles like research analyst, Technical specialist, Strategic planner, content creator, or backend developer.

89
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:48,060 6.974
Even in traditionally extroverted fields, look for the introverted niches in sales.

90
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:54,700 6.006
Consider technical sales where product expertise matters more than schmoozing in management.

91
00:13:55,367 --> 00:14:05,744 10.377
Consider project management or operations roles rather than business development. If you're an extrovert, look for positions with variety.

92
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:14,119 8.208
Interact and opportunities to think through conversation. Seek organizations with collaborative cultures.

93
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:25,097 10.811
Open communication and value for relationship building. Consider roles like Account Manager, Business development, Team Leader.

94
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:29,501 4.237
Trainer, recruiter or consultant.

95
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:37,176 7.508
Even in traditionally introverted fields, find the extroverted angles in software development.

96
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:43,682 5.872
Consider product management or developer relations in research.

97
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:52,758 8.909
Consider roles involving collaboration, presentation, or translation of technical findings for broader audiences.

98
00:14:53,425 --> 00:15:02,968 9.543
Now let's talk about managing your challenges. If you're an introvert, your biggest career liability is often invisibility.

99
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:12,778 9.576
You might do excellent work that no one knows about. The solution isn't to become an extrovert, but to create systems for visibility.

100
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:19,184 6.006
Schedule regular one on one updates with your manager where you can discuss your work in depth.

101
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:30,496 10.978
Document your contributions in writing where you're more comfortable articulating your value. Choose one or two networking events per quarter rather than trying to attend everything.

102
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:36,435 5.772
Prepare specific talking points about your projects so you're not caught off guard.

103
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:42,007 5.405
Find an extroverted mentor or colleague who can help advocate for your work.

104
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:52,117 9.943
Another challenge for introverts is the energy drain of excessive meetings and collaboration. Build boundaries around your deep work time.

105
00:15:52,284 --> 00:16:02,161 9.877
BLOCK off your calendar for focused work periods. Negotiate for some remote work days if possible, even in hybrid environments.

106
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,632 4.104
Take real breaks between meetings to recharge.

107
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:15,040 8.241
Learn to say I need to think about this and get back to you rather than feeling pressured to respond and immediately.

108
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:23,048 7.507
If you're an extrovert, your biggest career liability might be perceived superficiality or lack of follow through.

109
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:35,327 11.578
Your great at starting things and generating ideas, but may struggle with the sustained focus needed to execute The solution is to build systems for depth.

110
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:44,870 9.309
Partner with introverted colleagues who excel at implementation. Use project management tools that help you track details.

111
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,174 4.137
Schedule regular reflection time to process what you're learning.

112
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:57,216 7.875
Force yourself to do deeper research before meetings rather than relying solely on thinking out loud.

113
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,722 5.972
Find an introverted mentor who can model deep expertise and sustained focus.

114
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:10,462 6.439
Another challenge for extroverts is managing your energy in roles requiring extended focus.

115
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:17,603 6.507
If you're in a position requiring significant independent work, build in collaborative breaks.

116
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:25,377 6.907
Schedule working sessions with colleagues, even if you're working on different projects. Take calls while walking.

117
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:31,550 6.006
Process your thoughts through voice memos, or by teaching someone else what you're learning.

118
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:40,426 8.609
Join professional groups or committees that give you regular interaction outside your core work. Here's the advanced insight.

119
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:51,637 11.045
You also taught that we each have access to both orientations, but one is conscious and developed while the other remains more unconscious and primitive.

120
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,675 4.237
He called the less developed orientation the inferior function.

121
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:05,451 8.609
Understanding this is crucial because your inferior function will emerge under stress, often in dysfunctional ways.

122
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:20,766 14.681
For introverts under stress, the inferior extroversion might emerge as uncharacterized stick outbursts, desperate networking attempts, or manic social activity that leads to exhaustion.

123
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:33,045 11.712
If you find yourself suddenly trying to connect with everyone oversharing or making impulsive commitments, you might be in the grip of your inferior function.

124
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:44,623 11.411
The solution is to return to your dominant, introverted approach first process what's happening internally, then engage with others more intentionally.

125
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:58,403 13.613
For extroverts under stress, the inferior introversion might emerge as withdrawal, brooding, pessimistic rumination or paralysis through over analysis.

126
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:10,716 11.946
If you find yourself unusually isolated, unable to make decisions or trapped in negative thought loops, you might be in the grip of your inferior function.

127
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:19,825 8.742
The solution is to return to your dominant, extroverted approach. First, talk through what's happening with trusted others.

128
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:24,663 4.671
Take action. Even if imperfect, then reflect more carefully.

129
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:32,638 7.875
Once you've regained equilibrium, the most successful people aren't those who've mastered both orientation as equally.

130
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:41,780 8.608
There are those who fully develop their dominant orientation while learning when and how to access their non-dominant orientation.

131
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:52,558 10.611
And strategically, an introverted leader learns to give energizing public presentations by preparing thoroughly and building in recovery time.

132
00:19:52,724 --> 00:20:02,167 9.443
And extroverted analyst learns to produce deep research by partnering with others during the process and scheduling reflection time.

133
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:08,640 5.739
Let me share a historical example. Albert Einstein was clearly an introvert.

134
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:19,551 10.744
He did his best thinking in solitude, often taking long walks alone to work through problems. He famously said that he rarely thought in words at all.

135
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:25,424 5.773
But in images and feelings that he only later translated to language.

136
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:31,263 5.672
His greatest breakthroughs came from sustained, solitary contemplation.

137
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,969 5.539
But Einstein also recognized when he needed to access his extroverted side.

138
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:46,511 9.376
He gave lectures, engaged in vigorous debates with colleagues, and used conversation to test and refine his ideas.

139
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:55,120 7.808
He didn't try to become an extrovert, but he strategically deployed extroverted behaviors when they served his work.

140
00:20:55,654 --> 00:21:05,964 10.31
And crucially, he structured his life and career to maximize his introverted strengths while minimizing situations that would drain him.

141
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:10,969 4.604
Conversely, Richard Branson is clearly an extrovert.

142
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:20,479 9.343
He's energized by people, builds businesses through relationships, and makes decisions through action and feedback.

143
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:29,821 8.675
He's dyslexic and, by his own admission, not naturally inclined toward deep, solitary analysis of written material.

144
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:44,870 14.248
But he's built a business empire by leveraging his extroverted strengths, surrounding himself with detail oriented introverts who complement his style and creating organizational structures that play to his type.

145
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:56,415 11.111
Both are wildly successful, not despite their type, but because they fully leveraged it. This is the career strategy that Jung's typology suggests.

146
00:21:56,581 --> 00:22:01,920 5.339
Know yourself deeply. Structure your career around your strengths.

147
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:11,730 9.643
Develop strategies for your challenges and access your non-preferred orientation strategically, rather than trying to become someone you're not.

148
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:17,536 5.272
So here's your action plan. First, honestly, assess your type.

149
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:24,609 6.906
Don't base this on whether you're shy or outgoing, but on where your energy naturally flows.

150
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:36,922 11.512
Do you need to process experiences internally before acting, or do you process through external engagement? Do you find depth energizing or draining?

151
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:44,529 7.44
Do you prefer variety or sustained focus? Be honest, not aspirational.

152
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:55,340 10.644
Second, audit your current role and work environment. Does it align with your type strengths or constantly force you into your weaker orientation?

153
00:22:55,674 --> 00:23:05,884 10.21
If you're an introvert in a role with constant meetings and interruptions and or an extrovert in an isolated position, you're fighting uphill.

154
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:16,428 10.377
Consider how you might reshape your current role, or whether it's time to find a better fit. Third, develop your type specific career strategies.

155
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:27,472 10.877
Introverts should focus on building deep expertise, ease creating systems for visibility, and finding roles where thoughtfulness is valued.

156
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:39,584 11.945
Extroverts should focus on leveraging networks, partnering with detail oriented colleagues, and finding roles where relationship building drives success.

157
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:46,558 6.306
Fourth, learn to recognize when you're in the grip of your inferior function under stress.

158
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:58,570 11.345
Instead of pushing harder in the wrong direction, return to your dominant orientation to regain equilibrium, then engage your non-preferred side more skillfully.

159
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:09,915 11.145
Fifth, find mentors and colleagues who complement your type. Introverts benefit from extroverted advocates who can champion their work.

160
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:16,054 5.973
Extroverts benefit from introverted colleagues who can help with follow through and depth.

161
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:22,160 5.505
The most successful teams aren't all one type, but leverage the strengths of both.

162
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:33,972 11.645
Carl Jung believed that the ultimate goal of psychological development was individuation becoming fully yourself rather than conforming to collective expectations.

163
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:43,748 9.609
This applies profoundly to career development. The path to professional success and satisfaction isn't becoming the person you think employers want.

164
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:55,994 11.645
It's becoming more fully the person you actually are and finding or creating roles where that person can thrive. Your career shouldn't be a daily battle against your nature.

165
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:08,940 12.779
It should be an expression of your nature when you stop trying to force yourself into an ill fitting mold and instead leverage your union type work becomes energizing rather than draining.

166
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:17,382 7.808
You develop genuine competitive advantages because you're operating from your strengths rather than constantly managing weaknesses.

167
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:24,623 6.54
You find sustainable success because you're not burning energy pretending to be someone you're not.

168
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:31,263 6.173
The career advice industry often sells a one size fits all vision of success.

169
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:39,971 8.074
Be bold. Network. Constantly promote yourself. Think big. Move fast.

170
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:51,616 11.478
But for introverts, this formula is exhausting and often counterproductive. The same industry sometimes tells extroverts to slow down.

171
00:25:51,783 --> 00:26:01,459 9.676
Focus more. Stop chasing shiny objects. But for many extroverts, this advice fights their natural gifts.

172
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,362 2.736
Jung offers a different path.

173
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:18,009 13.48
Understand your type deeply leverage its inherent strengths to manage its predictable challenges and access your non-preferred orientation strategically when needed.

174
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:29,254 11.078
This is how you build not just a successful career, but a career that actually fits who you are. So here's your challenge this week.

175
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:38,330 8.909
Identify one way your current work situation is forcing you to operate constantly in your non-preferred orientation.

176
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:45,904 6.807
Then brainstorm one structural change that would allow you to leverage your natural type more effectively.

177
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:55,847 9.142
Maybe it's negotiating for more focused work time or more collaborative projects, or a different communication style with your team.

178
00:26:56,414 --> 00:27:02,354 5.94
Whatever it is, take one action toward aligning your work with your type.

179
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:12,364 9.844
The career you're meant to have isn't the one that requires you to become someone else. It's the one that allows you to become more fully yourself.

180
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:21,339 8.809
Thank you for watching. Let me know in the comments. Whether you're an introvert or extrovert and what career strategies have worked for you.

181
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,609 3.103
And as always, I'll see you in the next video.
